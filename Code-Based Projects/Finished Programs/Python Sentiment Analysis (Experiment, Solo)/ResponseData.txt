//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=282196403 After the game was rereleased on Steam, a Windows 8 user wrote a Steam guide on how to fix it to work on Windows 8. Note that this is done for the Steam edition. Its almost the same as the disc version, but instead of being under Steam&gt;Steamapps&gt;common it would be under its own little folder in Program Files, or under a Microprose folder.

 8.1? I do not know. It *just about* works on Vista - meaning that some of the tables appear stretched. It came out before wide screen monitors, so its video driver might have issues with proper scaling/aspect ratio. Plays fine on Vista though.
 Yes, this is an awsome game if you like pinball.
 A boxing-themed pinball machine, Spirit of (19)76 Haunted House, etc. Gottleib manufacturers.
 If you looked at previous questions and the answers that were given, it appears to work on Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1. I have it on CD, and know it works on Vista just fine on my older non widescreen monitor, however its still notorious for the dreaded stuck key situation on some games, meaning the key commands for the flippers sometimes stick.
 I really dont know, I do know it works on Vista, though I currently not gotten it reinstalled when I had to reinstall Vista over a year ago. I would imagine it might install on Win7 and work fine, unless there is a significant difference internally between Vista and Win7. I should note that I often played it on a standard aspect ratio monitor instead of my widescreen monitor (in dual screen mode) and it did fine. After all, it IS a Microsoft product so getting it to work on later OS may be easier than some others if you have issues initially as there is a make compatible mode for such older programs in newer OS.

 Dont know, I use it on Windows 7. There is a problem with it saving games, other than that is just like when it came out.
 No starcraft has a decent single player campaign as well as the ability to play scenarios and general free for all against bots or people or a mix. If you get the game do a search for custom maps and scenarios. The map editor is extremely versatile and people have made dozens of custom scenarios and setting. Ive even found mini rpgs
 Yes Sr!
 I play mine on windows 8.1 right click your desktop icon and go into properties and than comparability, go down the windows list and find which one looks best on your computer. Might also be an in game graphics setting and might be on Low, check that first.

 Yes, but dont buy it because Homeworld 1 and 2 coming out later this year remastered, and they will work on any modern PC.
 yes with some adjustments but you can get it to work.

 make sure you read each sellers description, not the header. each seller sells there item a little different. how ever if the seller states its in the original box they should provide you with pictures. if they cant dont buy it
 I say yes just because its always fun to have the old system...and sometimes the new system and games cant compare to the feel and control of old systems&#128516;

 Yes
 Wow its been years since i played ocarina but last time i remember, i dont think so but like i said its been years so you can probably ask another
 Yes this product is compatible with Windows 2000
 No!
 I\ve been playing this game for over fifteen years and I have never come across a single prostitute. It could be a typo, you can prospect for gold if you take the \Sacramento Trail\. Maybe he meant \prospectors\. I think it\s a good idea that you are buying this game for your grandchildren. Just be sure that they have a computer that can run it. I played it on Windows 95 in my youth but it works with my Windows XP laptop. Any newer Windows OS probably won\t run it. You could try stuff like \Doss Box\ but that is a route that you probably don\t want to take because of all the complex computer work. You could take the computer to a microsoft store but that could end up costing hundreds of dollars and even then, it\s not guaranteed to work. But if you do have the proper computer hardware, Oregon Trail 2 is the best version of the Oregon Trail series.
 There is just one disc, so no need to change anything during the game. It worked fine with my Windows 7 laptop. I just got a new Windows 8 laptop -- havent tried it on that yet.
 No it wont, not out of the box. There is a work around that you can look up online though, after that it runs fine. Ive done the modification myself and it works with my windows 8.1 64bit laptop.
 I never got it to work on Windows 7 ...it will only work on XP
 Normally no, but there is a work around that I found just by Googling for solutions. I can now play it on Windows 8, but I have to go into the file folder and click on a particular icon. It will then play in a smaller window. It does not fill up the entire screen. Otherwise it works.
 No. And the console didnt work. I used the cords that came to hook up to a previous console I already had.
 You should be able to plug it in the same and then go to channel 3
 It costs $50.00 and up, depending on the condition.
 You need to ask the seller which items are included, ask for pictures.
 It all depends on who youre buying it from. Read the sellers description to find out what items are included.
 No.this is for the pc only
 yes
 Go to Logitech website to download
 No, but it does have programmable buttons.
 It works fine with Euro Truck Simulator 2, made by the same company around the same time, so I would assume it does. Yes.
 after meny tries i could not get any of my old or new fighter programs to work on 7 -64 bit.
 Yes it does, works on mine. Have fun !!
 Yes. Ive run it on XP & Windows 7.
 Yes. Im running it on my laptop that has windows 7.

 I googled the question and found many forums of users using both the CH yoke and pedals for racing games. So yes they can be use for racing. - Dave
 I dont think so. My son and husband use this for flight simulator and they seem pleased with it.
 Mine do in Windows 8.1 x64. Also, plug and play, no CD needed.
 i actually do use these for Elite Dangerous and i have them set as yaw.. they work perfectly and needed no additional help or deadzone. they are spot on right out of the box.
 Yes, no problem
 I would not reccomend this for driver Sims limited turning radius.about 45 degrees each way.
 I cant remember but then again, who cares! You can and should customize them yourself and it is very easily done! One thing for sure, calibrate your yoke as otherwise it will not work properly! Its also very easily to do, takes 1 min at most!
 Yes
 It extends out the back. Its not much though.
 I have on way to test im on win7 for my games and sims
 It runs on AA batteries. The SP model has a rechargeable battery and should come with a charger, but this one uses regular batteries.
 Only separately
 no this does not come with a charger.
 I doubt it. They have even started to stop making stuff for the original Nintendo DS. For old consoles like this, it much more likely that you will find it easier online than from the company.
 Yes. To increase battery life, turn off color and volium
 No, the official Nintendo wave bird receiver is necessary. Other 3rd party receivers wont operate on the same fequencies
 It works with a Wii just fine. It wont work with a Wii-U because there arent any controller ports, but it works with a Wii.
 it works on the wii so i am assuming yes it will work for mario kart
 Either your GBA is malfunctioning, or the game is. Try another game to test your GBA. Also, try cleaning the pins on the game with a Qtip and rubbing alcohol. - DAMP NOT WET. MAKE SURE TO LET THE GAME DRY COMPLETELY BEFORE USING IT. The game will not save your progress if it needs a new battery. If it keeps crashing, then it is definitely defective.
 yes you can, I play it on mine all the time.
 Not sure. I play BF4 on Win7 Pro without any issues, however.
 Yes. When I had that joystick, I was using a machine running XP
 No you cannot. Not on the stick itself. But most who buy the twist handle rudder type sticks need/love that feature. You could buy a generic stick without twist handle to fit your specific needs.
 Hi Dennis The one I purchased has a silver grey trigger button. And it is flawless, works great.
 As long as it has a USB port it should work fine. Windows xp and windows 7 work fine, Im sure windows 8 should work as well.
 yes mine is. but be careful some are not. the old models are not usb
//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CXYMFS/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 No problems since!
 It may not work with an Apple product...the joystick is a Microsoft product...they (Microsoft & Apple) dont play together!
 Yes, it comes with all necessary wires and a controller.
 No it does not
 The Gamecube only supports AV cables. So if your TV has AV ports, which it most likely does, then it should work but there is not a way to play games in HD.
 Yes
 Yep sorry I thought I mentioned that in the review. Cheers
 Yes it is
 Well, I dont have a Mac book I have a Sony Vaio Laptop, sorry. I think you need to buy something like a small box that connects to your laptop so you can put in CDs. All in all, fun game.
 No. When I looked into upgrading to windows 8 that was one of the programs it listed as being non-compatible
 Yes

 No force feedback. No Z axis for rudder control either.
 Yes, no rudder controls though.
 According to mypilotstore.com the CH Flightstick Pro is compatible with Windows 8, but was not inclusive to 8.1. It probably is. Thanks, Ron K
 I have not encountered this problem before, but, if you enter the joystick calibration program from inside the Gold X program, you should be able to determine if the stick is operating properly by watching the response on the calibration screen. I do recall that years ago I had some issues with Microsoft CFS2 with loss of control of aircraft in the program, but, that was due to program errors and settings. If Gold X has difficulty settings, you might check those and see if they are set properly. Good luck.
 Hi. I believe that the combatstick could be used as it only requires a usb port and the companies software however I would e-mail CH products and inquire just to be on the save side. Also, this product has no twist grip feature so that would also be a consideration.
 No
 Ch should work with all library drivers-if not call CH in calif and get them
 Theres some conflicts in these answers, so let me straighten things up. The Fighter replaces two push buttons with one 4-way hat and one 2-way hat. Other than that the Combat and Fighter stick are identical. They both have a throttle wheel left of the stick, and built in trim wheels for the x and y axes. Trim is a bit troubling on most sticks since you dont get the feedback on the controls as less stick pressure is required. Dont think that this makes this stick bad since any sim that has trim has this drawback unless you have a force-feedback stick that simulates this (those are almost impossible to find.) The extra hats are great for modern jet study sims, but if you are into games like IL-2, there are normally enough buttons. On the otherhand you can map a ton of functions to all the extra contols, and adding a throttle that has a lot of buttons means you may not even touch your keyboard ingame. The Fighterstick tends to be at least 20 bucks more, so if you want the extra functionality, thats the price.
//www.ch-hangar.com/forum/index.php Good luck to you.
 The default model is right hand only, but I have seen a left hand version. I am not sure where it came from.
//www.chproducts.com/Flightstick-Pro-v13-d-723.html Dont think there was a written manual?
 Do not have any problems, but I dont use that often.
 No twist axis. Its a great joystick, rugged and reliable but a twist axis would be nice. Software is easy to use.
 Yes it can. I really cant recommend the CH Products enough. I own the Fighterstick, Pro Throttle, and Pro Pedals. I know several people using this setup on Windows 8. Just head over to the CH Hanger for any assistance.
 my old PC and my now newly-built one both have Windows-7 installed, and Doom 3 runs perfectly fine. Oh, and I\d stick with the 2004-05 versions of this and Resurrection of Evil, and not get the BFG Edition (as they nerfed the hell out of that one)
 Collectors value. The thing is the BFG edition is the better of the two. With the BFG Edition You not only get Doom 3, but you get the original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 3, Doom 3 Resurrection of evil add on pack, plus 8 new levels known as, The lost mission that was never before seen from the rest of the Doom world. While with Doom 3, you just get, well... Doom 3. However I suppose the price for Doom 3 would be greater as it does have a bit of collectors value at this point, especially with the new Doom game about to drop between 2015 and 2016. But I digress, if you\re gonna try to get into Doom, I suggest the BFG edition all the way around. I have both copies and BFG is a well worth it buy.
 I dont remember. I gave the game away after playing it. The game kind of sucked. Sorry
 I use one of these on a pc with Windows 7,64 bit. It is compatible. EA Need for speed shift2 unleashed works well if your video card is up to it !

 The red version does for me...same drivers, so I dont see why not.
 Yes
 No I dont know dont get this you have to have like 1984 software make a better choice than I did
 Yes you should download glovepie 0.45 and take a look at it.
 Probably, talk to the sellers. Or maybe its your games?
 Yes a little bit. But also is in color and lights up so it can be used in the dark.
 Everything was included an in excellent condition

 It is made for the original Xbox, and Xbox One is not backwards compatible. Not sure which system your 1 is referring to.
 Yes it did most people told us that it wouldnt but my son had no issues playing it.
 Yes
 Yes, Raymond, This version of Microsoft Flight Simulator does have 4 CDs CDs 1, 2, and 3 load the program into your computer. CD 4 must remain in your CD Drive to activate and run the program. Happy Flights!! DWL
 Absolutely.
 Yes
 drive of your computer since that will probably be the only drive being used at the time. If you want to add scenery or aircraft too the Flight Simulator Program, that will go directly into the FSX program.
 I use a LOGITECH EXTREME PRO. It is a joystick that is around $30. Google it to see what it looks like. There are much better and more expensive yokes and joysticks out there, but if you are just starting out, this is a good one to use.

 It does have a CD key, but the code can be reused. I have used mine to download it onto many different computers.
 No the game can be played right away through a link from Battlenet with the activation codes on the disks. I like the direct kind of access and would suggest if you are a true gamer you want to download the content on the disks to start the game directly from your pc without having to indirectly access it through the online link.
 World of war craft the last I check it was 15
 No sadly. I just got on the other night .
 I typically play games on my PC, not on my Mac, because of issues like this).

 Yes indeed... it is the default joystick in Star Citizens Arena Commander and works well. This is the main reason I purchased this stick.
 The joysticks handle itself twists approximately 15 degrees to either side for yaw, angles appx. 40 degrees (side to side) for roll, -pitches (forward/down) at appx 45 degrees and +pitches (backwards/up) at 30-35 degrees. What those motions will correspond to will really depend on the application in which they are used. Most flight games have advanced control settings that will let you tailor the response of the aircraft to the range of motion of the stick in advanced or personalized control set up menus.
 What other games is it compatible with? Is there a list somewhere? Are there any games included with the set-up software? Hank
 It does. There are better HoTaS options with more buttons on both hands, but this is a great stick for the price.
 Yes, it works, but its really small and inputs are approximate.
 This and halo custom edition both work for win 7
 Well a computer that can handle it, which isnt hard since its an old game. If you want, then an Xbox controller but thats optional. Really just the keyboard and mouse. I hope I answered correctly.
 you can use a game controller.That how I play the game.You will also like the game.
 Just a CD key as far as I know.
 no....not this halo
 I think it depends on which operating system you are using. We have the old versions and they still work on our recient up grade to Vista but there are some glitchs showing up that were never there when we were running Windows 98.
 It is a replacement break-away cable for original xbox controllers.
 Sorry. I dont know. I have the original x box

 They are better than the NES. Think Super NES type graphics.

 You have to either use another disk to install or choose the setup for the other two somewhere in game or at title.
 It does not have these animals
 My Zoo Tycoon is on a CD. I put it in my computer to play the game. My PC plays all discs. I am using a windows 7.
 Im not sure but if u read requirements it should tell you. I think it does though.
 Yes! It also works on Windows 8

 I just finished a puzzle an hour ago and I can tell you that it works fine on Win8.0, I have not upgraded to 8.1 yet. I hope this answers your question.
 im using Microsoft 7, no idea about vista, might be worth a shot, but I love the puzzles.
 Yes it will wook on windows 7
 No, it does not. Only offers WEP. I had to drop my network down to WEP to use this adapter for my xbox.
 uses AC outlet.
 Reset the router. Most routers have a button on the back that you push and hold in with a pencil tip or something for so many seconds. This will reset everything to factory defaults (including the password). Look up the specific router model on the Linksys website for setup instructions.
 While I cant give you a 100% as I dont use Win 8 (and neither does anybody i know, its REALLY unpopular here) it works great in Win 7 and if it works in 7 it nearly always works with 8.

 I am not sure. I use it for windows vista. I think Logitech has a website that should tell you.
 Nope.
 Where exactly would I be able to locate this information?? ( I checked under my amazon orders as well as on the ad. I am at work currently and am unable to open the program on my laptop at this time if that is where I would find it.)

 be very careful of what you are looking at. the picture you see on the opening page may not be what each seller is selling. you have to read there comments. some sellers sell just the console, some sell console and cord without controllers. YOU REALLY have to reach what EACH seller is selling. hope this helps

 the standard cord is about 4ft long. Hope that helps
 No just the console.
 Yes it is still for sale and works fine but remember youre only getting the consul
 Game runs awesome on my Windows 8 laptop. Due to that, it should run great on Windows 7 as well. If thats not enough, I have friends using Windows 7 that play the game fine. As for Vista, cant say for sure, but probably fine, since the game still works on Windows XP and 7/8, the older and newer versions.
 Call amazon customer service and they should give you a full refund, as they did for me. I too, was fooled by the resellers bait and switch tactic. When I called amazon customer service, my agent said he could see multiple similar complaints in the history. He immediately. Issued a full refund and even told me that I need not bother returning the product.

 yes it wil it has better response with a ps1 controller because the buttons arent pressure sensitive with a ps2 controller i find you have to press a bit harded for response but if you get a ps1 controller it does work percectly it also works well with ps2 arcade sticks and wheels

 I have recently purchased Windows 7 and could not download it on windows 7. I bought Hoyle Card Games 2012 and was easily able to download that. The 2012 version is very similar to the 2005 version. It has the same characters and games. Sorry I cannot specifically answer your question about Windows 8.
 Yes it works great. Only problem I have is no speech on characters but everything else seems to work fine.
 Yes..downloaded onto Windows 7 on all three of my computers and had no problems.
 Yes! It works just fine.
 I bet it does, I use it on Window 8. I love the bridge game, wish Hoyle Card games would put one out for iPad.
 yes it will but not mac computers and I cant use the one I bought .
 I couldnt get it to run on my windows 7...kept freezing and locking up the computer. Dont know if I had a defective disc or what but I ended up sending mine back.
 No. It doesnt even work on newer Windows 7 or 8. Dont buy this crap.
 It might
 No... its a great product, but it doesnt run on Windows 7 or 8. Youll need an older Windows XP to run it. I wish the publisher would revamp it for the newer OS.

 I bought this long before the release of Windows 8.1. (This was a gift for younger brother.) I dont want to assume that its not compatible. Do you participate on any online forums that focus on these type of games? They would be better able to answer this question for you.
 It will not work with Windows 8.
 I use it with windows #7. I dont think the one shown is the same as mine. My disc is by Random House Websters college Dictionary. Tropics entertainment and powered by Word Genius. There are lots College Webster Dictionary software. Some of them did not work with #7. email Tech support www.topics-ent.com/support. I thought I bought the only copy available. Tom
 Not that Im aware of or see listed. This is a very basic board. I didnt even know keyboards came with volume control.

 I use mine for TIE Fighter, X-wing, and X-wing Alliance. It is designed to be used in flight simulators and space fighter type games. I hope this helps you out.
 No
 Yes, its analog as well as an analog throttle control. The hat is a 4-way digital.
 I dont see why not if your computer can handle it. JJ
 I think so. it uses a USB plug so if your older PC has a USB port then it will work.

 No. It plugs into the same port as a wired GBA link cable, so it only works with Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player. If you want to access multiplayer functions of Game Boy Advance games, youll need those systems or a Game Boy Micro with a special adaptor.
 No. Youd need a Game Boy Color link cable (or Game Boy universal link cable), which is going to be hard to find as there are so many knock-offs. A genuine Nintendo cable will say Nintendo near at least one of the ends. If you cant find one, trading Pokmon is possible using multiple N64 Transfer Paks and Pokmon Stadium 2, but for other games, you may be out of luck.
 Each additional system needs its own wireless adapter to connect, yes. However, this is a wireless adapter for Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player only; other Game Boy systems and Game Boy (Color) games are not compatible.
 Interchangeable - yes. You get two different keysets - one regular, one gaming (WASD keys on the left and others). The keysets have a clip on the side that you flip up to change out and flip down to lock in place. You dont flip anything upside down. Hope this answers your question.
 I dont think that this keyboard will work with a mac.You should also really check steel series website on legacy products for that info an any other info for this keyboard.
 I doubt it. it comes with software
 This keyboard is not wireless. I dont use wireless keyboards or mice for gaming so I cant respond to the second question.
 Yes, it runs on my Windows 8.1 system.
 If you are talking about the LAN between people on the same network, you do require two copies of the same game so you can both play, one for each computer because the serial key is unique to each installation, and also because you both require a CD on each of the computers for the program to run.
 You should be able to find a serial key online. If you want to play online you have to buy the steam version (enhanced version).
 Titans lobby and play online through that client.
 Put the game in your CD tray. It may need to download something to your computer
 Yes
 Absolutely
 Yes
 I have windows 7 64bit, running Intel i7 extreme processor. i really wonder if there is any controller tested that can work on windows 64bit!!!! appriecate your output
)
 Doom might not be compatible with it. Are you on a Mac or PC?
 I plugged it into a Visual Land Connect and the D-Pad and left stick work, but all of the buttons appear to be Enter or Backspace by default. Havent figured out how to change that yet.
 It works with my macbook, and I did not have to install a driver, I dont know for sure about a MB air, but I imagine it woudl be the same
 yes i played left for dead with it on win7 and XP ..
 I think the cord is approximately 78 inches long.
 Its a pretty good stick if thats what your asking...as for closeness to a helicopter stick Im not sure of but as far as simulations go this is a upper mid range stick I think its worth the money. I use it for dcs a-10 simulator and its excellent and thats a very detail oriented simulator
//www.saitek.com/uk/prod/x52.html and go to the download tab at the top and download the correct drivers and software for your X52 Flight Control System. Make sure it is NOT the PRO version, unless you own a pro version. Your mouse throttle could be broken or a bad USB cable. I use mine for Microsoft FSX games. If you are using it for something else other than FSX, then that is out of my department.
//www.techwarelabs.com/reviews/peripherals/saitek_x52/images/Complete%20Contents%20saitek%20X52.jpg shows the connector types.
 That is what I bought it for. It works great for me. You can also setup the profile in ED the way you prefer. Takes a little adjusting and tweeking. So when you first start in ED use the trainer to test and get all the buttons assigned the way you want. I did not like the canned ED setup for the X52. So I did a custom setup and tested in the trainer before using it in game. Good luck
 Yes, though you will have to download the drivers from the Saitek website (Uses the same drivers for Vista, 7 and 8)
 Idk unfortunately but I sure hope so
 You will need to download a DOS emulator to run the game
 It probably wont. When I tried to install my copy a few years ago onto XP, nothing I did would make it run. I dont know if anyone else would know how to fix it, but I had my comp master friend try it, and even he couldnt get it to work.
 Yes.
 No, theres no standard video DVD for it. Its too customized and complex of a program to run in a DVD player. It exists for PC, Play Station 2, xbox (the old one, but I think the new one might play it), and for the Wii under a different name. These are the only formats Im aware of, and Ive done quite a bit of research. I personally own the PC and Wii versions.
 So far, I haven t had any real problems. A few things are a little different, but once you learn to navigate, it works well.
 Everything but the Address book. I have tried eveything and the address book does not work
 No
 I really dont know. WordPerfect licensing is less restrictive than other brands but I do know that WordPerfect Suite 8 is a very good inexpensive program for general word processing. Ill look in the literature that came with it when I get home and get back to you.
 Works well with mine.
 yes to both. no need to rotate. If I recall they even click together and stay put together. You can have a shadow like photo in the puzzle field to help place your pieces or you can have a small box/window up of the photo being worked on.
 the jigsaws galore isnt worth the money we paid for it I threw it away they did a poor job you are wasting your time to try to install it, go to big fish web site they have some jigsaw game to download very good ones they are called Jigsaw Boom 3 and jigsaw 365 not very expensive and they are real jigsaw puzzles very user friendly

 Yes. I used a genesis/Nes adaptor for mine that have two cords in one adaptor. Works great.
 I believe you would need TV and Power hookups if Im not mistaken. You can look and find them on ebay.
 Probably bc they have been lost along the way... the model 1 came out in 1989... gone with the wind I guess... or broke at some point
 Depends on the listing. Some work some dont
 Nawwwww
 I have the iomega USB KVM switch. My Saitek keyboards lights worked fine. The trick is that I had it plugged into the USB port on the PC, turned the lights on, then plugged it into the KVM switch. Works fine!
 Yes, that is the model I bought it for. I had no issues at all with it.
 No
 No, I dont think it is, but it worked fine and is still working fine.
 6volt I believe...
 If you get the CECH 01A then yes. Anything after, no.
 yes and I forgot the model number sorry
 yes
 I have no idea.
 Does this play in Window 7?
 yes, I have windows 7, and had this game over 4 or 5yrs, lots of fun
 Yes
 Yes its the original wii
 I mainly use my Wii for Netflix and Hulu. Such a good console for instant streaming.
 open-ended
 Yes
 Nope not even close. I consider this version better and more challenging
 No
 Yes. There a few cuss words in there, but not many and theyre few and far between. Most Need For Speeds are fine because theyre racing games so theres not much talking.
 It sure is. One of the ONLY racing games that seem to be now a days....
 No, youll need an original Xbox to play it
 Yes.
 Yes
/ if you can let me know, that would be interesting.
 It works the same. My son has the 3DS and this game works perfect on it.
 No but it can still be played on a 3 ds console
 Yes.

 What do you mean by steam?
 mine came in the case as required
 Yes, offline with Bots
 If you buy it new yeah its legit and you can play it. If you get it usd the key wont work and it wont let you play. I had to find out the hard way rather than going to steam and buying the game download direct.
 What is your definition of mechanical? This keyboard is can be programmed, has a small led monitor, which I use all the time. Keys are lit and and you can run your dvd and volume. Plus it has a full number pad. You can create macro commands for gaming. Keyboard is a bit old school, but I like it.
) My roomate hopped on the computer to take care of some business and even he said that this key board bites the big one. He was attempted to type up some documents and asked if I could put my old key board back on so that he could actully get his work done due to the keys not responding when he used them. Guess i will purchase the G15 for my gaming experience because i am going to take this dam razor and use it to help improve my skeet shooting skills.
 Are the hardware requirements met?
 It might be a little tricky for a 5 year old. I\m guessing this would be better for a child around 7-8 years old. That being said this is a pretty old game and we experienced problems with it on a newer (2004 iMac). Not sure if the same would apply for a windows PC but when we purchased it it was a universal powerpc binary and the windows version was for windows 95.
 When you click the on-off switch (button with yellow arrow) with the mouse, something should happen...
 are you still stuck on 85, I just got past it
 we are stuck at 16 also, wondering if there is a mistake on this one??
 I played and reviewed the game on Windows 7. The only Crazy Machines game that didnt work initially was Crazy Machines 2. I have reviews of these games on my website if youre interested (follow the link in my profile) as well as fixes for CM2.
//www.steinschaden.fr/soluces/crazy_nc/crazync.htm For 53 pay particular attention to the length of the fuse as the distance from 8 ball to the bellows is affects when the ball will travel. The official solution has the domino falling onto right hand stump of the basket and making a bridge with the hooks. The ball switches on the lamp. Also, make sure the solar panel is close enought to the light source, I think this is impotant, but not sure.
 My question exactly. I also really enjoyed The Incredible Machine games and would like to know if this is (1) a worthy successor (2) a blatant rip-off (3) a new twist on an oldie but goodie.

 I havent tried using this remote on my computer yet, but my old computer remote I had, worked on my 360. So I would think it should work. It obviously sends out the same signals. It is made by Microsoft, so why wouldnt it work with the computer?
 If you have an adapter for a VGA input yes. Mac uses other inputs depending on what year your mac is.
 It will work with an Xbox 360 elite
 Non digital tv- picture? If it has a female VGA port then it should work. The red and white is for a separate sound output. So like speakers. You can also get av to aux 3.5mm cord.
 I am using it on a 360S
 It sucks, dont buy it.
 Yes. At some point they switched from this AV cable to an HDMI. This is the original cable that was packaged with the first couple revisions of the console.
 Yes and certain games like mine craft need it to use multi player
 Im going to guess that it comes from creative marketing. Most likely they are referring to the fact that the audio outputs can be connected to a surround sound to achieve 5.1.
 The yellow cable is for standard definition television . plugging it in wont do anything. You have your audio cables (red and white) and your HD componet cables (Red green blue) and standard definition video cable(yellow) if you are not using an HD TV with component plugs such as an CRT TV the yellow video cable needs to be plugged in to the color coded slot (sometimes represented as a Y above another color slot)

 Yes it will work with Win 7. Plenty of people still play Sims 1 with Win 7, and I havent heard anything about any installation problems. If you run into any, try installing it as an administrator.
 My used copy doesnt seem to have any problems, after i installed it, it acted ask it should, all expansions were there and working bring back memories of the good old days, just go by there possiative rating and how many good rating it has,
 Yes. It comes with all the expansions.
 Yes. Just browse under The Sims Complete Collection Download and select from the available sites. I personally haven\t downloaded any games, so I can\t give you any further details. Hope this helps.
 SA on my computer which is running Windows 8 Pro...it runs perfectly, and without any incompatibility issues. The game doesnt have any lagging on my computer either.
 I would try to install using compatibility mode then try to run game in compatibility mode. If that doesnt work try running directly from install folder in compatibility mode and as administrator. Some games will not work on 8.1 though.
 You can choose which version you would like to buy. You can choose to buy the disc or the downloaded copy
 I dont know. Maybe so
 Depends how much memory your computer may have. Best if you get like an 8 gig USB drive or an external hard drive if your not sure how much memory your computer have. It really shouldnt take much memory these days since computers come with a alot memory.
 Im trying now, will update if successful.
 It includes; Galaga and Galaxian.
 no, it is not.
 yes that is what I have
 Yes

 Per nintendo.com......Almost all existing Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi games can be played on the Nintendo 3DS family of systems in 2D. With backwards compatibility, your existing portable games look and play just as well*.
 Sorry, I have a DSi. It works perfect on that. Havent used a 3DS yet. Hope you get a resolution to your problem! Have a great weekend!
 I do not know mine was in English. If their was something different my grandson would have said something
 We used it in a DSI and know nothing about the XL system. I would call game stop or Nintendo to get correct info, sorry I could not be of more help.

 Yes it does. I actually can\t distinguish it from the others so I wrote PC on the back of mine with sharpie so I wouldn\t get them confused
 Yes, they will.
 HDMI cable will not fit under this monster cable
 If you are using a TV with a component video input (Red, Blue, Green) then it will work but if it does not then it will not. This is a component only cable. I would recommend going with a cheaper composite option if your TV doesnt have a component video input.
 This does not come with an optical output. You have to purchase the fiber optic cable made specifically for the X Box 360 which comes with the needed adapter in order for this cable to output Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.
 Yes
 It is an analog sick and the switches are membrane
 Against the older Razer gamepads based on the Nostromo design, this is a MUCH better game pad. It is very comfortable and responsive. The software is a little more difficult to use, but its easy enough if take your time and experiment with the setup. I cannot comment on the newer Razer Orbweaver/Tartarus, as I have not used them. However, they still look similar to the Nostromo designed pads.

 Yes, I can play it on Windows 8 with all the latest patches. If I remember correctly, tho, you need the origin libraries/app installed as well, but I could be wrong about that.
 Yes it does. I believe I had to go in as the administrator after installation and force it to run in Windows XP mode, but have had absolutely no problems running this game on Windows 8.
 Yes. Best to install it using origin.
 Yes, you only need the internet to load the game. It may warn you that no internet connection is available, but it is not necessary once the game has been installed.
 Yes I have played it before on there many times and works with all high settings.
 My Printmaster Gold 17 would not work with Windows 8, so I am using it on another computer with Windows XP. I ordered Platinum for my Windows 8 computer and I am very unhappy with it. Most cards are without text.

 Cecilia I wish I could help,but this was a gift for our Grandson who lives in Tennesse and we live in Plattsburgh New York,I am not a gamer and he is on the go all the time ,so I dont hear from him.
 Im not sure I bought the actual game
 Yes, it comes with both the intsaltion disc and the game disc!!!!!!
 What do you mean the one below it?
 It worked on my Windows 7 computer. I havent tried it on 8.1 yet.
 No product key is assigned to each software it will either not complete the installation or crash upon use sorry have tried with other products
 I dont know, I run the program with windows
 my copy was a cd and would not work with windows 7, it helps if you use some kind of joystick as you can get behind the helicopter using a keyboard, hope that helps
 Should run fine, graphics may be a little off, as in detail/resolution. Would recommend a check with MS\s website to see if any patches are required for Win 8.1.

 Yes, it works PERFECTLY with the Playseat Evolution. (Not sure about earlier generation Playseats.) The Evo has pre-drilled holes that line up with the bottom of your G25 wheel platform and your G25 pedal platform, though you will have to offset the Evo pedal panel quite a bit to where its strange looking but not impractical from a functional standpoint. Look into buying the additional Playseat Evo attachment for the G25 shifter. I dont think Amazon sells it ... I ended up getting that attachment from MaxWho.com.
 Yes
 Ive only used it with grand torismo, but Im sure it will work with all driving games. Only compatible with Play Station.
 gtr is good but if you play online get rfactor ps try some demos
 Its a catch 22. Any PS2/PS3 wheel will work for Dirt, but you wont want to use it. There is significant steering lag with Dirt. Which means your going straight and your car is still turning, it makes for a very frustrating experience. Cant speak for how it runs on the 360 but on the PC itll run good if you have a very powerful PC. Your best bet is to stick with a controller if you only have the PS3 version.
) (Im 12)
 Not that Im aware of you better off with the stock fans and if they are bad just get new versions ...my whisper fans started getting bearing scream so just go with stock ones !!!&#128512;
 Its been over a year since I installed this on my elite. What little I remember is that everything matched up fine. Maybe different versions have different fan plugs? Hopefully someone here has opened up several original model 360s to verify this.
 No this is for the original fat system
 my scale said 5.4 lbs.
 IDK either ... I bought it and got the standard version. I do not see much difference except for the metal on the pedals which maybe makes them more durable. I use the pedals with Windows XP as my OS; the interface of my pedals is USB, the Saitek Drivers get the pedals into my computer and Saitek includes a program to check that the pedals are working. BUT to get the pedal info into any running program they have to be linked to the Windows Device Manager by going to the Control Panel and Clicking on Game Controllers, then clicking on ADD then scroll down to Saitek and select it. I made a screen shot but Amazon does not give me a way to attach it to this e-mail.
 We dont know of any list but he uses this specifically for Elite Dangerous. He says the rudder pedals can be programmed to any game just like a joystick.
 Yes thats how I have them hooked up
 Yes
 Should be.Just use the optical ports from the Pioneer plug it in using the provided toslink cable to the Xbox 360 HD Cable. There is no need to have your Red and White audio jack in the TV. The Xbox 360 will effectively bypass sending audio to the TV and will send the digital audio signal directly to the Pioneer. Then have fun. But if you want your TV to have surround sound make sure it is connected (Audio out) to the Pioneer.
 i have them both hooked up
 100W x 1 (RMS 10% THD@100Hz)
 This system (as far as I could read) has only Audio inputs. HDMI is an audio and video cable. If you are trying to connect this to an HDTV that has an HDMI input, then chances are that it has Digital Audio output too. Simply hook this digital output to the sound system. there will be some finer tweaks you need to workout with the tv such as whether the tv volume controlls the output volume and if the TVs speakers should then be turned off. For more personallized help, most High school to college aged boys/men, and an increasing number of women, have the knowlege required to get it working at a livable level. usually a trip to a Best Buy with a list of the items you have including brand and model number can prove very helpfull too.
 this cannot be used with any other receiver/amp, as it has a built in amp inside the subwoofer.
 Indeed it does, without any issues or driver installs. Works right out of the box.

 Minecraft for PC never came with a gamepad option, youll need to use a program called JoyPad to play MC... But that goes for any gamepad not just this.
 Yes. I run Windows 7 ultimate 64bit and it works just fine.
 No sorry you need to buy those expansions seperately
 yes
 yes, it should!
 Alan, i cant really answer your question. The copy of this game that i have for sale is $150.00. The reason it is priced at $150.00 is that based on the other copies available at the time I listed it $150.00 seemed like a fair price based on what other seller were asking for their copies. Beyond that, Im at a loss. I dont play video games and dont really know what an Expansion Pack involves and so Ive no idea why they only cost $5.00. Perhaps there is less to them than the game itself.
 I dont think so, I believe you have to buy an adapter for it.
 Yes, you can play DS games from Germany on a US Nintento DS and vice versa because the Nintendo DS is region free so you can play any games from any region on your console. You can set the language when you set up your DS.
 Yes, but always ask the seller to confirm this.
 Yes but not ds2 or later games
 Ds games and games boy advance sp games. The ds games go on top in the back the small slot and the Gameboy advance games go on the bottom.
 Not that i know of....
 in a word, Yes.
 If you have tile or hardwood floors it doesnt slip! It kind of has a non slip grip at the bottom to help.
 If your asking does it have a reaction delay, we have never noticed one. Excellent DDR pad. It gets ton of use at my house. No complaints yet
 It does not. It has limited access to the Internet in general.
 They appear to be but then I cant get mine to play in color on my HD TV, so Im not 100% certain.
 Yes the gamecontrols is inclued
 The game controller is also used as Dvd / Blu-ray remote, it does not come with any other remote.
 Mine came with one controller
 Absolutely!
 The ones we bought were bought used a few years ago and all cables required to play were included. The PS2 system is no longer made and good quality used units are harder to find now. Good luck!
 SCPH 90001 CB / 97706
 if your asking about the wires to connect the console to the television, the answer is yes.
 usually works fine on my Windows 7 system. It does fail sometimes due to DirectDraw error.
 You can install the game on an unlimited number of computers and LAN with buddies without needing the disc in any of the computers!
 sorry not that I know of
 NO.
 I dont believe it comes in a download form. Mine came in a disc pack. It also plays without a play-disc so it can be loaded on all of your computers.

 No its adjustable enjoy!
 Should work as long as the Thrustmaster wheel has a table (flat surface) type clamp as do most wheels
 You can, no problems right foot braking.

 One of the reviews claimed that there were unofficial Mac drivers that worked well. But I dont know from personal experience. Your best bet would probably be to Google it.
 I played on windows 8 and it seemed to handle it alright, but I think I had to change some computer settings.
 No. You have a choice of single play, or 3,4,5,10,15,25,50 and 100 play.
 I dont know. It stopped working on my PC, so I uninstalled it. When I tried to remove the disk from its holder in the case, it was so hard to remove that I cracked it in the center about half inch. I tried to reload it into my PC several times, but nothing ever happened. However, I would think that the disk could be downloaded to as many computers as you wished. Francine

 Yeah, the sick has twist for yaw/rudder control. Even has a twist lock if you plan to use it with rudder pedals. I would recommend that you mag mod the stick though as the stock sensitivity isnt all that great. Its a simple mod, and makes a world of difference (YouTube for tutorials) if you sent scared to fiddle with the stick innards.
 stick, throttle, cable between the two, USB cable to computer, CD, and a quick start pamphlet--make sure you read ALL the reviews--this system can be tricky to get working, depending upon your system
 Its pretty intuitive, and there are tutorials on line. Be sure to use the software from the website though, and not the CD version that comes with the stick.
 Perfect For Project M , I Got This Very SD Card Just For It And Works Fine
 No. Definitely not. Regular SD. Not SDHC
 Nothing at all. You are not paying for all the non-recyclable plastic waste for individual unit packaging.
 black. Its probably the flash on cameras that make it look grey. Its the color of the mouse itself you need to watch out for. Or youll end up with non matching glows.
 I havent got to compare them, but the Copperhead in terms of performance is definitely better, but a lot of (right handed people) people might prefer the Death Adder because of the right-handed design. I own a Copperhead, it is the mouse to slay all other mice in terms of sheer performance, so slacking a little on performance really isnt that big of a deal. If I wasnt a lefty Id probably prefer the Death Adder.
 No it wouldnt. You would have to get an official Gamecube to Wii U adapter
 yes. my computer actually auto-downloaded the drivers(windows, sorry). google 3 in 1 magic joy box drivers and you should get there.
 i have NO IDEA, i would like to ask what makes everyone think i have all the answers, i as ONE question in the past and i get asked questions, in what world does that make ANY sense...
 Yes, it does work, it doesnt care what controller youre using, you just set up the controls through your emulator and play. No special configuring.
 An Elusian Tail, which is designed for an Xbox controller so the button mapping was off but I think thats a consequence of the game.
 Although Timelapse was originally designed for Windows 3.1 or Windows 95; with regard to WindowsXP, it runs best (without lockups or crashes) when the Compatibility Mode is set to WindowsNT 4.0 with Service Pack 5.
 I was not able to get it working on Windows 7. I had to install a virtual machine running Windows 95 in order to play.
 I dont think so. And I havent found a patch for it yet.
 I highly doubt it. The connector is PS specific.
 Yes it does it works on every ps3
 Didnt work for my PS2 to PS3 so I doubt it.
 Definitely! In fact, thats why I bought it, so I could game on my PC with a PS2 emulator.
 I didnt see if the analog button was mapped as ps3 button. However it might be since ps3 uses analog all the time. I was using my PS3 Blu Ray remote to go to PS3 menu
 Not if you buy the PC version. It needs to be the MAC version to run on a MAC. You can tell which version it is by looking on the upper left hand side of the cover.
 Yes. I have Windows 7 (American) and this deluxe is compatible. Hope I helped!
 It didnt work on my windows 8. So I dont think so.
 Yes
 I never downloaded anything, but I guess you could retry it. If that doesnt work, re-install the game, or call customer support.
 No, this is not compatible with the Gamecube. However, you can play Gamecube games in progressive scan using this cable on a Wii.
 Not sure about the wii u. I used it on my wii
 Im not sure. My son ordered it, & hes not available to ask. Wish I could be of more help!
 The Wii Mini only supports the regular composite cables (red, white, and yellow) unfortunately.
 Adjust your TVs zoom settings. If your TV lacks those, adjust the Wiis over scan settings. If THAT doesnt work, get a better TV.

 Tiger woods pga tour 08 only works with windows xp and windows vista. You should find out about a newer version in www.easport.com that applies to Apple. Sorry for delayed answer but I was traveling in the northern part of my country which is Argentina, South America
 Yes it will play on Win7 x64, I do daily.
 it will arrive in the official Microsoft Xbox package
 Nope you cant. I tried doing this but the receiver had to be connected.
 It will charge through PC. In order to use the actual controller through the PC, you need the Microsoft adapter. I bought this item and the adapter; works great. Still cheaper than buying a wired usb controller, although those are good too.
 Yes, its a standard microsoft battery, works great with any microsoft charge kits like the duel black MS charge station.
 both. the idea is that this would normally be used for a PC.
 I got my husband, who is the owner of the game to help me with the answer. Unfortunately NO, that particular game does not have trophies. A particular good way that you can determine even before you purchase your game is to look very closely on the back cover of your games hard case. In the very top portion of the paper label (top Rh corner) opposite the Playstation Network name it will say (ADD ON CONTENT) and underneath both languages stating that will say (TROPHIES) that DOES NOT appear on your game in question. It IS on his AC II greatest hits, AC III, and also his RELEVATIONS. We hope that this has helped you. Remember to look on the back top right of your cover sleeve, thats where they print that sort of info.
 No
 no the game is in english
 Why yes it is!
 This came used from a third party seller, so he included everything listed.I think you have to read each listing if used and see what they are including.

 There is no built in wifi with this console. Only the new slims have built in wifi. These units you will either need direct line with ethernet cord or need a wireless adapter for it to work.
 Please read the seller notes to confirm what is included as each seller may provide a different bundle.
 Hi Tanya! It will come with the standard Xbox 360 headset, but does not come with an Xbox live code.
 I dont have a mac but I think it would. It depends on what you are doing with it, because it might need drivers that are not available for mac.
 I assume so because it works all my ps1 and ps2 controllers but Ive never tried a dualshock 1
 No, it doesnt. My brother bought one to use for guitar hero and it didnt work.
 99% of the time will will work with other pc and or the ps3. I have used it on both for gaming and even used a ps1 controller. also it depends if your using it for a type of game like street fighter vs. say any other type of gaming hardware. It would but not unless the software/ game your playing allows for that type of controller to be used. and if its not fully compatible for that software it maybe have issues if it doesnt work, youll have to read on each type of software used before purchase and or etc. Mainly do research before you do.

 Im not sure, this one works on my old xbox360 which is not the newer slim type.
 No, it appears to be 110v only.
 Thought this was a part for the Xbox a gaming system but it doesnt work at all
 110v
 A few hours
 No, that is the battery within the game cartridge, which is a watch battery.
 Probably, your original battery is ten years old now and has cycled a lot of times.
 When I purchased my replacement battery, it came with a yellow screwdriver that fit perfectly.
 Yup. Theres an airplane adapter included.
 I use mine for running, biking and cross country skiing with no problems. They fit well under a helmet or watch cap. I live in interior Alaska and have to keep them in a warm place before putting them on as the metal in the frame can give contact frostbite (like a burn blister) if I leave it exposed to outside temps too long and put it straight on. As long as you dont turn the volume up too loud, you should be able to hear cars or other people just fine. It will never be as safe as exercising on the road without them on, but I really enjoy having music or audio books while I exercise.
 YES THEY ARE, WORKS REALLY WELL.
 I believe it is on a sticker on the brown box they were packaged in. Dont remember for sure as it has been a while since I bought them.
 I had the same problem, still under warranty, and the company refused to fix them. Do not send them back to B&O (who wanted $50 to fix mine). Go to a local electronics repair shop. I did that and had them fixed for $5.
 If you have an Xbox 360 with the Kinect you can play this game but it will not use the motion sensors because it was released prior to the Kinect. This game is played with a controller.

 I just replaced the batteries in my remote and did not have to remove them to fit in charger supplied with my Wii system. They just fit the charger and the back of the covers have contacts that match the charger to the remote without removing the shell nor battery. Charging lites come on and change colors when fully charged.
 Yes it does. I have 2 wii plus remotes I use with these batteries.
 The version for Windows 7 doesnt work properly, it has too many bugs. I also have a netbook that has Windows XP and the version for the XP works fine.
 no
 there are three others , and then you have to choose two of them. You also can play alone
 This works with the Xbox Original Controller, however I am not sure about Windows 8 as I use Windows 7 and Mac OS X. This works great under those two operating systems. I do not see why it would not work as long as the driver installs.
 Yes
 To PC, it might.. to Xbox 360 definitely no.
 The adapter will work for any original XBox (released in 2001) controller (regular, mini, dance pad, or Steel Battalion); it does not work with Xbox360 or Xbox One controllers. It is less than 3 ft long.
 About 20 inches

 Well, neither the guide nor the game developers really say what the best time is, but Ive found that when I go fishing, there tend to be more bites on rainy days at any time, and on sunny days from about 7-9am and 6-10pm. Also, I tend to get the most bites in the river on the farm, just below the chicken coop and nearby the bridge. This may not be true for everyone, it just seems to be the case when I play. Hope this helps!
 The blue book signifies a recipe book, a cookbook if you will. The number, which is actually 0 (zero) P not OP shows how many recipes youve actually cooked. Once you cook one recipe, the number will go up.
 Go to the beach and fish.
 watch the t.v.
 I dont know if theres any such support, but since this game is essentially a spaceship RTS and not a flight simulator, I really, really doubt it.
 This game is not about the clone wars....
 Download again
 You can also download it off Steam. Steam is a free download. Make a free Steam account, download Steam, and buy the game
 Im not sure if you can. It may be possible but this is a question for STEAM support. STEAM offers the game as well. I would purchase it through STEAM if possible.
 when you move the levers below the detent at the bottom, they hit buttons, these buttons are programmable, and can be programmed to reverse your thrust. Ive been using these for two years and it works great for just that. If you fly a turbo prop, you can have one for fuel cut off, and more.
 Hello, The Pro Flight quadrant (pz45) is a usb connected peripheral that can be used together with the throttle quadrant that comes with our pro flight yoke for multi engine function.
 Im not quite sure. Try contacting Saitek or view there website to troubleshoot it to see if it may just be a driver issue or a software issue.
 Hi, I cant remember exactly - I seem to think its around 500mm, it has to be close the the USB port. I run all mine to a 12 port powered USB and extend that to the PC
 Yep. Connects fine via hubs and direct to mainboard
 I havent had the issue at all and Ive had it for 2 years. by reading reviews I think it was solved in fall 2008.
 no, 45 degree rotation
 My yoke doesnt bind. Sensitivity is adjustable within the software. Mechanically speaking, mine works fine.

 I tested the multitap on the very first version, not the slim.
 Only certain games use this accessory, and different games tell you to connect the controllers differently. Check the manual for the game you want to use it with for details. If you dont have the manual, ask in an online forum either one for video gaming in general, or one specific to that game.
 Yes, it does.
 Yes it does work.
 Backgammon battling ships, bump em, checkers, Chinese checkers, chest, dominos, crazy contraptions, tile games, master match, maximum pool, maze racer, maze Raider, parchisi, panic, placer racer, raise, Reversi, rummy squares, rUnes of Avalon, solitaire arcade, star collector, sodoku, time breaker, word games, yacht, and zilch.
 The game wouldnt work on Windows 7mso I returned it.
 yes, but under the name rummy squares.
 The version I have (2007/2008) has the games you ask about plus 24 more, some very good and some not so. Double cross word game is very good, plus the slide tile game is a real favorite. Well worth the money for these games.
 Yes. I play Hoyle games esp. the card games.
 yes.
 Go to Hoyle Bucks in the Game Items section, and continue to scroll through the items until you see the items for sale that you can\t see beforehand. In other words, the invisible items. Click Buy or Purchase next to each one of these, and you\ll have all of your colored dice. I also was interested in using the colored dice, but after trying each of these different colors, I personally decided that the white and cream colored dice were the best looking ones, even though they were the colors already unlocked to use when I first installed the game. The various colors such as red, green, purple, and other ones didn\t make the Zilch game any more entertaining to play. By the way, does your Help and Strategy section work at all? When I click on that, nothing happens.

 Yes, it plays both play station 1-2. Play station 2 needs bigger memory cards..compared to play station 1. It kind of nice, one doesnt have to replace all their play station one games..
 There is no hard drive, you need to have memory cards for a ps2
 Im guessing you have this controller and not the console? I would say no because the ps2 has 8 sets of male leads which the factory controller plugs into then you would have to take into account the size of the plug of the controller and the console housing. So if youre gonna get a ps2 it should already come with 1 controller if not just spend the extra & get 1 that will 4 certain work.
 Yes it can.
 Just AV jacks.

 I have the original G15 and I hope it never breaks since the change was pretty drastic. The color orange is good since when I have a lot of white on my monitor the keys are barely readable since the reflection from the monitor makes my blue keys hard to see. I currently use 14 of the keys, most with shortcuts to programs. I memorize where they are and I have one button access to them. The fewer keys now means that I will now I have to use the M button to toggle and then select. This adds another step, but I guess its fine since I only use 14 of the 54 keys provided. I rarely use them in-game.
 Yes, the keyboard and the software that comes with it is compatible with windows 7 and 8.
 I have the same problem.
 Yes, it works on windows 7!
 I do not know if it works with Window 8. I have Window 7 on my pc. Sorry. Harold
 You have to put the disc in the drive to play. Hope this will help you. Harold
 dont use mac my os is windows and it works ok on it.
 they only certify their fip on msfsx. they do not comment on other sim engine

 Pro flight instrument is used to show aviation instrument info.. if you want to show a map with gps location you can export out and show on a monitor
 Yes. If youre not going on line to do multiplayer, no problem. But to play online, you need all the updates and install the oldest in first. I really liked playing Combat Flight Simulator 2 a lot, too. Anyway, Microsoft shutdown their servers so multiplayers a thing of the past. If you can find #2 get it. Course you need a joy stick. If you want to go online to play a multiplayer combat flight sim, try Aces High or Warbirds. Look them up on Google. Hope this helps.
 Donald- I finally got CFS3 to work on my Win7-64. I had to go into the control panel to software installation. Run compatibility program.
 It will work with windows 7, 32 bit, 64 bit has some problems and it will work with the extreme 3D joystick -- to some degree -- some of the features of the joystick dont work as they do with MS flight simulator. You can fly with it, engine speed, up, down, right, left so on, but some things such as bomb, rockets are controlled by the keyboard. At least I havent found where those buttons are?? Dont expect the same results that you can get with regular flight simulator. Good luck.
 no you have to have a flight stick

 Technically, no, it will work on its own, but in such a limited manner you are best off picking up a move controller.

 mine didnt. I bought mine used. it had some issues but over all its a good system. if it doesnt have one already, then youll need to buy an hdmi cord for Blu-ray discs, and to enhance video game graphics. I suggest buy a relatively cheep cord here on amazon.
 Yes standard online service is free but you have to pay for sonys storage for copy protected saves...i dont think it costs to play games online or anything? Just setup a PSN account & your good to go i think?
 your question is not clear, please rephrase your question so I can help you.
 In the hypothetical situation where one does download and play an emulated game, it works very well with not only the controller layout being similar to commonly emulated systems (SNES, N64), but also is very responsive. I use a regular PS2 controller myself and in my hypothetical situation pod I see myself playing and enjoying emulated games that I have never personally downloaded in reality.
 It will likely make them be axes. I purchased one to convert my yamaha ms1 handlebars to PC. It worked great for that.

 Not sure. Perhaps the games official website might have some information.
 As this is a computer game, there is no need to hook this up to your TV. Now if you have a screen no bigger than a watch face then Id say if your able to hook that up to your TV then most definitely do it. I run this on my laptop and its just fine. Enjoy!

 The game does require a broadband internet connection. Offline mode is available only in those circumstances where you temporaily lose a connection in which you may continue to play for that session only. Even then you have to login as a guest even though you own the game. Guest privileges only last 30 days before you have to login to a live internet connection to re-register the game. Otherwise, you are locked out of your own game. Kinda sucks doesn\t it?
 Its not a hacked copy and yes you will be able to play multi-player and solo campaigns.
 No and I highly recommend this game to improve your poker game! Can play more hands per hour than even online poker sites if you choose to skip all the AI reaction time or skip to next hand once you fold.

 To be honest Ive never had this problem but my best advice would be to either contact EA or I know on YouTube they have serial codes for the base game and expansions so you could also try that but theres no guarantee that could work, worse case scenario is you return the game and purchase a new copy.

 No it doesnt come with a charger. It is only the controller.
 I believe so. Thats what my husband did with his
 The wireless controllers (at least the ones Ive had) dont take batteries. You plug it directly into the console to charge it. The system has to be turned on for the charge to work, but after keeping the controller plugged in for 6 hours or so (for a new controller), you can unplug it again and probably go 20 or more hours before you have to charge again. The red power light on the controller starts to blink when the battery is getting low and all you have to do is plug it in again for a while.
 No, it did not come with blue tooth dongle.
 Yes you can.

 From everything I have been reading on GTP, this wont work on the PS4 unless Sony updates it so it can be used. If you are buying this for the PS4, expect it to not work. Yes it is USB and Plug and [lay and all that stuff. But If Sony has it blocked out, It will never work.
 They arent big paddles but there are buttons on the back of the wheel that are used to shift.

 Not in actuality, no. Ping is a measurement of how fast data travels along the internet pathways to the server and back. This data is transmitted in the form of electricity, which is traveling at very fast speeds. An average internet connection spans hundreds of miles between the server location and the user, and typically only sees ping around 40 milliseconds (1/1000th of a second). The additional 50 feet of this cable produces no measurable effect on you internet ping and speeds, especially in relation to the scale of things.

 I had XP when I bought these games. But I just checked on BigFishGames which is where I bought them and it does list Windows7 as one of the Operating Systems. Many of these older games do not. I don\t think you\ll have any problem playing on 7 but I have had several games recently that are compatible with 7 that will occasionally freeze up.
 the Microids version will probably run OK; some adjusting of the games properties through its or gfx options may be necessary. I do not know if the Big Fish version is altered from the original; that could introduce issues. Pardon my bias but I am wildly enthusiastic about this game, which I find to be challenging and just plain fun. To solve compatibility issues, I dual-boot XP/Windows 7 so I can keep running XP or earlier games that are not compatible with Windows 7. One is able to dual-boot Windows 7 and 8 - which is a viable option for you; a web search will give you many good tutorials on how to go about it. Post back if you have any questions. If it were me (its not) I would buy grab the Microids version (you can query Amazon merchants to see what version they are selling) at least knowing that one person was able to run it on 8, albeit with some issues (that I suspect are related to his specific setup). Regardless, it, to me is worth the gamble. Ed
 Together with the Myst series, this is my all-time favorite game. I have played this game on XP, Vista and then I downloaded the game on windows 7 and it worked great. I dont have a win 8, however I believe Microsoft uses similar technology to allow backward program compatibility. If you like this genre, try Tunguska.
 You should be fine with UJC mart Japan. Make sure you check out not the item reviews, but the company itself. In general Japan wont be giving out counterfeits, however China and Korea are a bit more risky to order from. Hope this helps.

 It works on US wiis and gamecubes yes. Theyre not region locked.
 Glossy like original. Ive got all three plugged in to my Wii U, and just compared them. It is pretty hard to tell the difference, but finish on this controller looks/feels most like the original game cube controller.

 I dont think it will. The device was designed for PCs in general. If your XBox360 is hacked in some way, it probably could be used to play PS1 games...though honestly most emulators dont support force feedback for DualShock controllers. It does vibrate quite well when the drivers are installed and when you are playing a PC game that supports force feedback.
 It works great with wired gamepads on my USB 2.0 systems.

 Did you buy a physical DVD game or did you by a download game? I have the physical DVD game and I do not need to use the disc (after initial installation) to play the game. I purchased it this way intentionally because some of the online downloaded games have to be run through an online server like Steam and there fore can only be played while you are on line (WIFI connected) and I use my laptop while traveling and seldom have a WIFI connection. Since you don\t have an internal DVD player your options would be to buy an external USB player (they can be very inexpensive, from 19.99 up) to download a physical DVD of the game or buy an on line downloadable version.
 There is no code. You literally just pop the disc in and install. However, any saves made with the steam version are compatible. I played the steam demo of torchlight, and then deleted the demo. The installer found the remaining nested directory within the steam folder and installed it there, allowing me to pick up where my character originally left off. Personally, I prefer a steam-free experience when possible. You can always add a link to this version through the add feature in steam client. However, you cannot add this version to your steam account.
 Bud, it cant ALL be filtered, near-colorless pallets of gore and grime. Cheer up, Im sure therell be more of the same old kind of hack-slash soon that you personally prefer. Not every game is made to please every person, move along, apparently theres nothing here for you--there might be for someone else though.
 All games have the platforms they are designed for plainly visible on their covers. Some might say Mac and PC some just PC. X-box and other console systems have their own unique platforms and manufacturers will specify those that will play anothers platform in their instructions. The Torchlight game I purchased and is pictured here is for PC only.
 They are stereo headphones. Your sound card probably has something that simulates surround. Mine does. Very good headphones.
 I didnt know there was a color difference. I purchased the ones pictured and they are awesome
 For flat and accurate sound its up with the best. Its not the most ideal for bassy music but it will hit all the notes. The Xonar is good, these are only 32 ohm and can be powered by most sources.
 You can always set that option through playback devices in Windows. Just right click on the mic device in playback and choose listen to.
 Ive owned about 5 headsets in the last 2 years. This has been the best headset Ive found on the market when it comes to sound and mic quality. It does lack features like mic mute when boom is up and on can volume controls.
 It works well with my Windows 7. My kids love to play it, and havent had any problems with it so far.
 Yes
 open-ended
 Disc
 No
 Most of them are Jasper mb, just a few you will find a Falcon motherboard. A tip is look for the manufacture date, after dec-2008 every single on I saw was Jasper
 yes
 Yes
 No, it havent. You need to buy the wifi dongle for it.
 No steam required.
 yeah, thats the multiple player version
 Modern Warfare Most of the Tests are Platinum, so it should install and run just fine. It seems versions 1.4 thru 1.6 are the Platinum but version 1.7 may have some problems.
 I dont know why it wouldnt. I played it on a Win7 machine, and it was made for machines older than Vista. Either way, you should be ok, as long as your video card meets or exceeds the recommended requirements.

 What do you mean by this Hello, The model is CECHE01. This thing only lasted 3 months after I got it. Thanks
 Yes, that is correct.
 No just the console
 This console is not backwards compatible, in fact the only PS3 that ever was, was one of the first units made, a 60Gig unit. It was only backwards compatible compatible with PS2. I had one of those for years, it finally died when a visiting dog decided to urinate on it! All PS3s have build in wifi and hdmi output.
 No
 Yes, the version i played is
 Yes, it works, but last I tested it was mapped a little strangely by default.
 From using a tape measure, I came up with 102 inches or 8 ft. 5 inches.
 I cannot say if it works on all of them but every game I have used it on for both mac and pc it worked great.
 just steer, fire, roll, and select object in reticule. Unfortunately there doesnt seem to be a way to customize the calibration.
 Yes and yes. The Joystick twists AND the throttle has a rocker bar (you cant see in this photo) for rudder control on the back. Both snap back to default when not actually twisting/rocking.

 Yeah, the less heat the better for the system. Having the fan boosts the chances of extending your PS3s life by at least 3 years depending on how often you use it.
 It is not loud .. but it did not prevent my PS3 from overheating .. it might work for you ..
 It covers the back of the PS3 completely and is flush with the system. Doesnt really work though as it actually caused my PS3 to overheat faster.
 Yes
 it should. The game worked pretty well on my windows 8.
 I like it and it makes me think I could fly a big plane if necessary. Maybe just my ego though. I have flown a couple of small plane but never pursued my pilots license. I think it is realistic.
 Yes, Ive installed it on Windows 7, 64 bit OS and its working
 Hi, The Steam needs an internet download of upto 15 gbs. Regards
 Ive never had that issue. Mine works great with both of my dual shock 2 controllers. It could be that they arent true sony controllers, or that a button has been configured to be automatically activated. try reconfiguring the buttons and if that fails reinstall the drivers. If that doesnt work, your unit might be defective. also make sure your controller doesnt have stuck buttons inside, I had that happen once, had to take it apart and clean it with windex and cotton swabs.
 Yeah this does work with windows 8.1
//prosperouspoverty.blogspot.com/2009/02/microsoft-sidewinder-x6-gaming-keyboard.html has a great write up on the board and addresses concerns for purchasers including the problematic key combinations. The noise about the lack of height adjusters on the back IMO is over blown since the board slopes slightly upwards. Additionally the non removable hand rest is higher than my Saitek Elcipse was so I havent had a problem. This was my one main concern and I thought worse case I would put something under to slant it but I havent had to.
 this has been release for a couple of days now. You can purchase it now on Amazon!
 Yes
 It is a port of the PS1 version, which should have all the endings, as well cinematic and some bonus features.
 It does. 3DS is backwards-compatible, and plays all Nintendo DS games.
 It will for sure, but for future reference, it will not be compatable with 3ds or dsi enhancement games from other regions. Fortunately though, any plain ds game is fair game.
 Not really sure but its not likely that you would be getting a pirated copy if you get it at a reliable sources or website, but if youre not sure dont take the risk just trust your gut.

 My so called chatpad has not worked from the day I got it.
 It sounds really weird like loud and echoey
 Yep all
 This headset is just to talk to friends and people. You cant hear the game. But, it is useful I like to chat with my friends.
 Trike Bike, Piper Cub, Cessna, Float Planes, Twin Engine Aircraft, about seven different Jets,737,747,Airbus,Helicopters, and more than one plane in each category, it would take time to name all the planes, and there are flights to and from almost every continent in the world, it would take a long time to accomplish every thing that this simulator teaches you to do and all the cockpits and gauges are realistic to the lane you are flying. For the money the best piece of software that I bought.
 No you can use the key board and mouse but a joystick makes it a lot easier. If you using windows I have all kinds of problems. iT SHUTS OFF in the middle of flights. If I knew when I purchased it I would not have wasted my money.
 We ship only by First Class Priority mail, which needs regular 4-10 working days to USA.
 I have Window 8 and have no problem installing the game.
 Hello, We are sorry but we can\t (Amazon doesn\t have this ability) attach pictures to general questions. We are not sure but we might be able to send a picture if you use Ask the Seller Question?? Sorry for the trouble.
 110 thanks for your question Mj
 Yeah you can you can buy some on amazon and other places lukie is also a good place for old games thats were i get all my old games
 No
 No it did not come with controllers, just the console.
 For me it worked in Battlefield 4 in the search menu. The touch pad didnt work though.
 I never tried pairing it with other blutooth device, but I believe it could be done.. at least I paired a blutooth earphone from third party to my PS3, so I guess there would have no problem!!
 The key does not light up, there are 3 or 4 small lights around the edges, but those only tell you either its charging or its on. You cannot see the buttons in the dark. Like any key pad, you will get use to where the buttons are over time but this pad is not really made to have long conversations, its best utilized for short messages. I had my doubts when I first brought it, but for me it was a good investment.
 Sorry. Its design is quite limited. Check with PS3 support. Maybe theres a way around it.
 Yes it does.
 Yes
 No it does not have force feedback
 Yes it will. You have to clear all the default joystick setting tho in the game. It\s pretty straight forward. However, Ive noticed that in BF4 there is a button or two that seems to be bugged. I use the two buttons in front of the throttle to afterburner, and it keeps opening up a damn menu. In all honesty, it works wonders in BF3... But worst in BF4, They seem to have optimized it mainly for the game pad and mouse/keyboard... At least when flying a heli. i\m not much of a jet guy.
 Kind of. I really havent played it in sometime. I would search more on YouTube on it
 All of Saiteks products are programmable and therefore can be modified in simulators such as FSX etc. I am not familiar with your simulator or program but I am sure that you can obtain the map of the buttons and knobs and therefore change their functionality.
 Not at All. It\s a decent-looking panel, but has a lightweight feel, which could be good for some, bad for others. Be aware, though, (since I wasn\t), that this panel is only compatible with FSX, and possibly Prepar3d.
 Yes, If you have it off before you start xplane (This is what I use) and then try to turn it on, it wont. You will need to reset the game or move you plane via the map to a different location. Before the computer screen loads, you will need to switch it back to Start then BOTH. Hope This helps.
 Its a computer attachment si yes it should work no problem specially if you have win7 and up where driver updates are automatic.
 Yes. Be warned, though, thats is only compatible with Microsoft FSX. The driver software does not allow for custom programming, it has a plugin that automatically loads with FSX.
 padded, a little more comfortable, nice size mic, medium size headset, reasonably priced (depending on where its purchased)
 Regrets, but I cannot help there ... I bought it for PC/Skype, not gaming. All it is is basically a set of speakers (headphones) and a microphone, so Id imagine it would work with your game system, but it wont do anything like vibrate or whatever game-specific headgear might do.
)
 I don\t know if you would be able to use the microphone but there are all types of adapters that convert the pink and green jacks into various devices. Just type in pc to ps3 headset adapters and find one that you think will work for you.
 Yes. As long as you have a 3.5mm jack to connect this headsets own 3.5mm jack, than it will work great.
 No
 Other than re-calibrating/centering - sorry no.
 Yes. Both work on an axis just like the throttle. If you watch the lower cockpit, you can see the aircraft controls move in response.
 Yes, you can. Works without problems. Mountain Lion.
 yes
 Yes
 It came in the original case unsure if it came with Manual but was in good condition
 You do not need the steering wheel at all to play. You can use the Wii mote by itself, or the wii more + chuck combination
 We have played with 4 racers at a time
 yes

 No, this will only work if you have an account on the US playstation store, your physical geographic location does not matter.
 the only difference I see is the price, it costs 57 black and blue 49.99
 No, delivery is through the postal system. It is a physical card with a code on it. The picture is an actual picture of the card.
 Yes, is the better (almost the only) way!
 I would think that all psn cards work on all operational gaming systems
 This is only for PS3 controllers. They dont come with battery packs. All you have to do is push the controller into the slot and it charges. Its really easy.
 Yes, its support both voltage.
 open-ended
 I wouldnt recommend it. Because it could be fire-hazard, or treat it as one , just to be on the safe side. &#128549;
 Yes
 yes, I had no trouble downloading onto mine Windows 8
 Yes there is Hearts,but I dont see Canfield.
 Yes
 Yes, Gin and also Rummy 500 are listed in the contents. Have fun! This is an excellent program.
 yes I love to play it too
 No
 Sorry, no it wont I purchased it on Windows xp and then I had to switch to windows eight, tried several times to download it and it just wont work. I purchased Reef one, two and three. loved them and makes me angry it wont work. Any more questions or concerns please let me know.

 The psp 3000 has a 3.5mm headphone jack according to various websites (i can honestly stick in most of my normal headphones/earbuds) The PSP 3000 does have built in speakers. Also note that I believe the psp 3000 does not have internal memory so you will need a memory stick for your files.
 it dose not come with a memory stick but you can get one on amazon for a good price I love my psp
 Yes, the PSP will plug into a PS3. It uses the same mini-usb cable the PS3 controllers use. There is not a whole lot you can do with it other than transferring games, however remote play is still possible with a select list of supported games.
 I am afraid not. This is a separate console compared to the PS Vita. Think of this as the PS2, and the Vita is the PS3. Now as for the, not seeing games that come with this, this is just a specific model of PSP, any game labeled as a PSP game will work on this console, just as any game labeled as PS Vita will only work on the Vita. Hope this helps.
 No beacuse the psp vita games have a higher graphic engine and it will not support it on the psp 3000
 yes it does
 I would think so. I download to my kindle. It s a playrix game and on Amazon you can get it for your Ipad. Have fun with it. Love the game
 Yes, it does work
 yes it does
 The game came up clean after doing a scan with ProtectionID. Unless its hiding deep in the game, its good! In fact, all three discs came up clean.
 Last machine I ran it on was a win7 republic of gamers laptop. It had to run in compatability mode, but I was able to play it (with minimal hicups, but some graphical degradation) I was using a beefy spec rig though, your mileage may vary. I havent tested it on windows 8/8.1
)
 Yes! Flawlessly.
 Its perfectly semetrical in every aspect, it could be used with either hand.
 I havent had any trouble and no signs of it weakening on me at all its been overall the best one I have ever had
 Works well with War Thunder, thats why I got it.
 No
 Yes, works with all windows platforms from xp and up.
 Yes the gas pedal is realistic. I use mainly for racing but i can go around a track at 2 miles an hour or 102 or anywhere in between. for the money i recomend this wheel setup to anyone. i am sure the more expensive wheels have a better feature or two but not much better. also recomend iracing and asseto corsa for the most realistic racing experience available in my opinion, if into racing games.
 It has up to 900 degress of rotation.
 this is the answer i got for the same question I am positive that the G27 will not work in the PS4 for now because of the absence of a Sony PS4 security chip in it. Without this chip, the G27 shuts down in 8 minutes. This is how Sony protects its PS4 license. It may work in the future if Logitech manages to negotiate a deal with Sony. The 8-minute shutdown restriction can surely be circumvented by a firmware upgrade. There is actually a petition going around among G27 owners for that to happen.
 Ps3 and PC only, XBOX 360 does not accept this wheel, only Microsoft branded wheels can be used on XBOX
 It only works with Windows Media Player. it has a small number of apps that came with it that aren\t really very helpful, it looks like they went pretty over Functionality and scouring the web, pretty much all the app sites for aftermarket apps are gone now, but I DID find a program called Aida64 that can be used to create custom apps, that\s all I\ve used since I made one for system stats. and game support for it is pretty light. google it and read the wiki on the g19 and you can see the list of games that support it. nothing terribly new so not sure if games are even trying to offer support.
 This keyboard is not wireless capable. In the gaming community, wireless is unacceptable -- time lag, etc. This keyboard needs plugging into both USB2 and electricity. It even prefers a USB port on the computer itself, not on a hub. If you want a wireless, try the Logitech K350. It doesnt have the bells and whistles of a gaming board but is excellent in all other computer functions.

 I assume that youre referring to the plug on the AC power adapter. That 2-prong AC plug fits any standard household 110 VAC power socket right out of the box... it doesnt need the 3rd (grounding) pin that you see on most AC power plugs nowadays. And, you can plug it in either way - it doesnt matter. Enjoy your keyboard.
 I use this headset with Vent, Teamspeak, Mumble, RazorComms and others. Not sure if that answers your question. If not, please be more specific.
 While Windows 8 is not listed, it should work with Windows 8.1 I briefly tested it and it required the disk in the drive to work.
 Auto Word Validation, Pop-up Hints if requested, and a few Best Plays if you ever just get stumped, as well as, a Merriam-Webster Official Scrabble Dictionary built right in. Hope you find what you are looking for.
 YES
 Its just Classic Scrabble; timed or untimed; play against the computer or solitaire. You can play with more players on the same computer. It has 8 levels, from Beginner to Genius. I have Windows 7 and it works fine.
 NO. It comes on a CD that has to be in the CD-player every time you play it.
 Yes they will
)
 the wheels are designed to accommodate a Wii controller. the mario kart version should not have any impact on its fit.
 NO,its plastic
 Im pretty sure it will. I think the wii remotes are all the same size.
 Yes!
 The games are actually on the discs, they are to my knowledge the full game.
 Windows Vista / XP Only
 Good question! Im always curious about things like that myself. But this game is completely written for your computer. NO internet is required to download or play, either one. And, you also have the option to custom download which games you actually want. But if you dont know what the games are, I suggest downloading them all, and going back through each menu separately, and double click uninstall on the ones you dont want. No internet is required at any point.
 yes
 Hi I have recently bought a new Laptop which uses the Vista operating system. And so far have had no problems installing games. Many of the games I play are old 2005-7 and all seem to run no problems. Also newer games such as Age of Empires and Medieval Total War II are running well under Vista
 no you have to buy a new copy once the code is used its invalid
 Once the game is installed, you play from the internet. Youll get weekly updates that download when you log in. There is no need to have the CD in the computer. Just be connected to the internet.
 Yes, better graphics, but gameplay is similar.
 If you selected the PC box and not the PC Download box underneath the Platform options on the page, then yes it will receive a physical copy of the game. You will need the code that comes in the box before you can play the game. You could always try the PC Download option if you didn\t want to wait for shipping. Please note that if you select PC Download you will not be getting a physical copy.
 You just need the regular version of GW2 to play the game.
 This is for US consoles.
 I couldn\t even get mine to play a European copy of the movie Tank Girl staring Lori Petty. My PS2 is a US MODEL # SPCH-77001. It is a slim, soft modded, and will not play black bottom or blue bottom disc\s so I can\t use my GameShark to launch anything which is why I like the Action Replay Max due to it having a silver bottom which is the same for the Swap Magic, so be sure of what kind of bottoms your PS2 can play. The Action Replay is to allow you to turn your PS2 into a region 0 or region x DVD drive reader for movies and not games. So no it won\t let you play your imported games. I would go with a Swap Magic if you are looking to play backups or imports on your PS2. I have Swap Magic and it allows me to play all my backups, imports, and I even have a back up of my Action Replay Max because my soft moded PS2 won\t play the original but my backup copy will and it works with my backup games. You can find PS2 Swap Magic NTSC USA here on Amazon or on ps2cover.com or stoneagegamer.com who are selling it for $24.74 plus tax on ps2cover and sold out on stone age gamer, and that\s without the lid for the slim ps2 if you have a fat ps2 you will need the slide tool. If you have a slim u will need the flip top cover unless you soft mod your slim like I did and then you don\t need the flip top but I\m thinking of picking up the lid and buying another slim PS2 and use it on that and not soft mod it because then I can probably use my region free function and watch my import DVD\s using my Action Replay MAX. Be sure to get the NTSC U.S.A. version of swap magic if you have a U.S. PS2. The PAL version is for non North and South American PS2\S so be sure of what version you are purchasing. If u want to play backup PS1 and imported PS1 games on your PS2 I would recommend the Breaker PRO NTSC, and this can be found on ps2cover also for $19.95. I still need to buy one due to my PS2 won\t read my GameShark due to it\s blue bottom. I hope this helped you and also the Swap Magic NTSC version 3.8 DVD comes with some cheat codes but I haven\t had any games to try them out with. When i bought my Swap Magic it stated that the DVD disc was version 3.6 but I received version 3.8 along with version 3.8 CD. I hope i was able to help you out a little bit.
 It has some base line cheats for the main characters. However, in searching the internet, you can find proper cheats for the game, including leveling up faster, always getting an item with a monster battle, always going first. I do not like the base line cheats as they are auto maximum stats and levels for the characters, no fun at all. But, the found cheats, allowing a little help and going faster through the game without having to spend hours leveling up.. those make the game very enjoyable. Hope this helps.
 I don\t think it matters which model number the PS2 is. I have heard that it does better on the old PS2 fat. I\ve had both the newer slim and the older fat consoles, and I like the older PS2 \fat better.
 Maybe it might not sure
 you can buy it on steam for 29.99
 Yep. I have W7Pro 64bit. No issues.
 not sure - but with Window\s 8 and 8.1 you have a compatibility mode that can set the Operating System that runs the game back to prior versions of Windows. And note, when I say, Operating System - it\s just the environment that the game runs in, not your overall PC Operating System Environment. With Windows you can keep checking as it checks each prior version of Windows to see which one the game works on, and when it does, it will Set it in its memory. That way whenever you do run the game in the future, it knows what settings it needs in order to run. Good Luck.
 I installed it on windows 8 and it work. The game was way more old school than I like so I didn\t play it much.
 Yea, they worked perfectly fine on my windows 7, no patches or nothing
 I could not get it to run on win 7
 The games overall are not censored. Although there is an option in the pause menu that allows you to turn off the gore/blood and guts when someone dies.
 i have windows 7 64 bit and i had issues with it. updated firware and all. Got the replacement and it did the same thing. Updated that firmware and same thing. The pointer just randomly moves on its own. It is an issue with this operating system you can google it. Tracking issue for mamba mouse. They say it could be from having stuff like hard drives running on the computer desk but not in my case just my keyboard and mouse and monitor.
 -_- Here comes the racism.... WHO GIVES A SH**T!
 No, its pretty old
 I could not find any option for any other language. Sorry
 Not sure. I sold the game in less than a blink!
 It is one controller with two parts. The main rectangular controller which is used for all games and the nunchuk controller which plugs into the first controller and is used on some games.
 No
 yes
 Yes.
 I cant speak to this but we are very happy with the controller. We use it for Skylanders, Mario Kart, and Sports Resort. It works just as effectively as the Nintendo brand one we also have, these are extras. I dont know if this helps....
 Yes! I used a gamecube controller, but there is a classic controller for the wii. You can also use the wiimote only, but I think that would be really hard xD. This remake is absolutely amazing. Definitely try it out! The GC controller is what I recommend.
 Not in the traditional sense, this has no elements found in many RPGs. Other than playing the role of the (player choice) character selected from the very beginning, you play out the respective role of that S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) team member with no customization abilities.. No experience feature, no gear upgrades or crafting, no turn-based battle. This is about as far from those types of RPGs as you can get, and not considered to be one at all. It spawned a whole genre (Survival/Horror) following this games debut.
 Should be able to since Wii U is backwards compatible but I am not positive on that since I dont have a Wii U.
 Yes. WiiU has backward compatibility so that you can play your old Wii games. Just have your remote, speakers up, and let the scary fun times begin lol
 No, this version does not require steam. The entire reason I bought this game was because it does not have steam at all.
 windows 7 is listed
 No. The only way you can play this game without the disc is by purchasing a digital copy.
 I believe the game checks for the disk. No drive, no disk
 It was not included in my copy of the game. I should think that if you had to old poster that it would cover the present game.
 Not sure I understand your question. This is a customizing case for the hardware. No software comes with this purchase.
 No special tools needed at all. Also, the fans work really well with the casing. If u send me your email address I can send you a pic of what it looks like after its all installed.
 Just the case
 Mope
 No. You get four options to choose from for your response.
 Hi, No, the one you are looking at is for Windows. To find a Mac one, go to the Amazon Search and type in Jeopardy Deluxe Mac and you should find them. The box is white for the mac, blue for the windows. Thanks. Rocky
 Yes it does and is very easy to upload to your pc.
 Yes, it works on Windows 7. I installed mine and it download just fine. I have a HP laptop computer. I recommend this Jeopardy game and The Price Is Right.

 Yes it does. it works better the orignal adapter.
 It works well on mine. I have also used it on the old Atari and it has worked well.
 I believe so
) Make sure that the VCR has composite outputs that are compatible with your new digital television. If you TV only has HDMI, you should have got a different tv. You can also get an RF to composite adapter box, but these are quite pricy ($150)
 Yes.
 No.
 yes, most definitely! should you be able to get a close up shot of the keyboard to the left, you will see the six main keys in the center which includes the q, a w, s, e, d in the centermost area. all of the numeric keys are up above those from 1-11. the keys to the left of the q and a keys cover the alt, shift, caps, tab, and control keys. the keys to the right of the e an d keys cover the alphas, r, t, f, g, v, b, p, c and a jump key. i hope that you can get a good visual from the description that i gave. When I first got the keyboard, I thought that there was no way that I could become functionable with the set up. Honestly, the transition was so very fast! I first transitioned by using the keyboard to the left and at times hit some of the keys on the regular keyboard to play. I do believe that you will be very happy with it!
 Yes, the LED in the keyboard has 3 colour options, Red, Blue, and Purple. Theres a button at the top for colour change and LED brightness.
 Even though the profiles are really out of date, you can still go in and set them up any way you want. So every key is configurable for whatever you want. Just set up the profiles and make sure to select the right one before going in to your application. Ive had my keyboard for a couple months now and have barely scratched the surface of the configuration options.
 Just the price. Its still 12 months of xbox live.
 Yes, this is for XBox Live. The same as the membership that you would charge to your credit card but you are just prepaying for 12 months (I think they have a six month plan too). Im not sure on downloading games. I think that might be different. They have XBox gift cards for that. We ordered one of those too. Hope this helps.
 I believe so. Even if his account expired you should just be able to reactivate with this card. Kinda like a prepaid phone card would work.
 It depends on who you send it to,for family and friends as a gift buy the card send them the 26 digit code on back of the card thru email or cell phone, once code is used card is no good,if its for selling to a stranger,it wont work.
 Yes if it has both languages just incase you dont know one of them. It could be the product was made in China but no big deal you use it and disgard or recycle once used the pin. Enjoy.

Im not sure on downloading games. I think that might be different. They have XBox gift cards for that. We ordered one of those too. Hope this helps.
 I believe so. Even if his account expired you should just be able to reactivate with this card. Kinda like a prepaid phone card would work.
 It depends on who you send it to,for family and friends as a gift buy the card send them the 26 digit code on back of the card thru email or cell phone, once code is used card is no good,if its for selling to a stranger,it wont work.
 Yes if it has both languages just incase you dont know one of them. It could be the product was made in China but no big deal you use it and disgard or recycle once used the pin. Enjoy.

 Yes. I am currently running Windows 8 and works great.
 Its an IR camera that tracks head movement by bouncing IR off of a clip you attach to a hat. Its used in gaming to translate your head movement into corresponding movement in game. For example, in a flight simulator (where I use it), it is used to control your view in 3d cockpits, giving 6 degrees of freedom in the cockpit as if you were really there. It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

 The package as shown above is about eight inches tall and only a couple of ounces. It arrived in a box that was like 4 x 6 x 8. I don\t have it in front of me, but the above are fairly close.

Within the software that runs the system you can modify how much you have to move (its resolution). Just like the DPI settings for your mouse. I\m pretty sure if you were to make it as sensitive as possible you could spin your character\s view quicker than you can see things on the screen. Like taking your mouse and wiggling it vigorously and the mouse cursor almost becoming invisible, if you know what I mean.
 I wouldnt advise it. Since Microsoft servers do not support a lot of XP systems anymore. I suggest upgrading to Windows seven. I have Windows 7 Ultimate and a great video card. If you do this, make sure your power supply in your pc can handle a better video card. Otherwise, you can damage your system.
 If it just said PC it will send you a physical copy of the game... If it said PC Download then you would be able to get it trough download...
 Yes we can. Please order it and check our rate also

 36 inches
//www.amazon.com/Classic-Nintendo-Wii-Gamecube-Game-Cube/dp/B007PVC30M This is the item you want for N64 to Wii.
 The cord is 5 feet 6 inches, I used a tape measure.
 Yes
 This can be accomplished with programs such as Xpadder, AutoHotKey, or EventGhost. You can do this with most any controller, though.
 I run Ubuntu 12.04; its been fine for ZSNES.
 its plug-and-play, no cd included.
 No you dont. Best game ever
 The first one is rated M-Mature so I assume this one would be the same. The game involves shooting zombies so there is a lot of gore in it. Heads and limbs are blown off the zombies. I have seen in the options where you can turn down the gore, but of course I have never tried it. Its a fun game where you have to learn to work with teammates to survive. Im not a mother so I really dont know what age Id recommend, but if I had to Id say... high school, maybe the middle school age if you turn down the gore.
 I m not sure. I know you can play two players co op offline
 You just have to make sure ur wii has american system i think if its british this would not work this is from my experience Im not sure if its true or not
 No it doesnt. You can only use the Wii remote. You can either have it turned on its side, or have the nunchuck hooked up to it.

 You can play all Wii games on the Wii U as long as you have the wii remote. You cannot play Wii games on the Wii U gamepad, though.
 You can play with just the remote

 If you have a color TV or monitor
 No. The fit meter is only an add on to measure daily activity which then adds to the Wii Fit U score.
 Yes
 Yes! Perfectly. NO problems.
 A couple of the things you can, but most require the board to make sure youre doing exercise right, weight check. The only thing I do not use board for is the running. In my opinion, the game itself is too costly, since you wont be able to do most exercises, without the board. But your answer is, yes you can do w/o board.

 No just your standard psp games but this is just a straight download device so you have to download your games or cinvert your games to computer and then to the go. My opinion of this psp is its not bad its nice to not carry all those games. but it sucks downloading games cause it takes to long. hopes this helps
 Yes
 The psp 3000 is a great gift for your son
 No u have to buy ur own
 You can download it through the PSN and do not have to wait for the disks. I will caution you however that the PS3 version is not really very good due to its hardware limitations etc. Its playable, but tends to be very laggy in high traffic areas. I stuck it out until the PS4 version came out, and used that instead. If you dont have a PS4, you can still play well enough to justify buying the game for PS3 though. Hope that helps!
 Yes Zines, You have already answered your question. Although this game is so addictive, YOU CAN\T PLAY WITHOUT A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION BY ANY WAY, there\s no offline game, even the main story needs a monthly fee. YES, it\s a dumb. You pay only for a Blue ray disc with the game data and an online pass for 30 days of TRIAL, when those days ran out, a message like this appears you have to pay a subscription in order to play. That\s a shame...
 Contact the company. I have had that happen before.
 It has mild blood, violence, very little language. It just BARELY scrapes up to mature. I have had this talk with a bunch of people wanting to get their child Reach. It should not be rated Mature, and the thousands and thousands of times I have played it I have never felt disturbed or like it was inappropriate for children. You DO do things like run aliens over, or jab a knife in their brainpan, but it is just comic violence. Like LEGO games; isn\t it morbid to hit someone and have them explode into pieces? ;) Just saying, this game has violence but it is very mild. Many of the Halo games are not deserving of their Mature rating. Hope this helps you some!
 Yes it can
 Only if you want to go on line to play with it others. Other wise you can play anytime yourself
 In short, no. Halo 1 & 2 were ported to the pc, but they stopped doing that after 2. All the other Halo games (Reach included) only work on the consoles they were made for. The only way to play Reach on the pc is to do some serious hacking, or use an illegal torrent to download a hacked copy. The one pictured here was specifically made for the xbox 360, so it will not work on a pc (again, not without some serious hacking).
 Depends on the kind of fun you want. Bungie did Reach so there is a lot of fun to be had where the characters are actually funny and the playability is great. Halo 4 (not Bungie) takes itself far more seriously little to no fun stuff, just an attempt to make the story more serious. Halo 4 has immensely better graphics and if you like thick plot and story and a solid multi-player then that\s your game (co-op is completed in less than a few days so not worth it for just that). Reach was the pinnacle of Bungie\s evolution of the game, a must-have for any Halo fan. I personally don\t consider Halo 4 even part of the franchise, more of a spinoff because it\s SO different.
 Yes
 Yes, its an X-Box 360, that is what this is for.
 open-ended
 No
 It comes with a plug..my kids connected it to the xbox 360..I hope that helps.
Games/Fallout3. Also note that Windows Live no longer exists so you can not validate it nor do you have to. You essentially are buying this so not to get malware or viruses from pirated copies or you just do not want to wait forever to download it off steam. Took me 5 days to get it running good with over 50GB worth of mods. Great learning experience, awesome game, 10000X better than when I first played it.
 Yes, Im running 7.1.
 You should be able to do it. Makes sure it is the same type with the one you got. Sometime there is add on with the new one.
 Its not a code, it comes with 2 disc but I never got to play it. I tried endlessly to install it but I couldnt! ! Very frustrating to say the least. I have Windows 8 on a very nice computer. I tried just about every lead on how to install it but to no prevail. Lucky I have it on Xbox 360, this game is awesome but I wanted to play it on my computer for the conveyance of playing it anywhere. Good luck!!!!
 Windows 7 pro, Linux OS in windows emulator mode, or gamble on Windows 10. If none of that works, then wait for it to be on sale on steam, I bought FA3 on disc an later again on steam because it runs a bit smoother since there is no disc spinning an they made it more multi-core processor friendly, same thing as the multi-core fix, just updated.
 Pokemon Emerald is a transparent green, fakes may use a solid green; the Official Nintendo Seal will also be on the logo sticker, some fakes forget to put that on; another the nintendo logo on the cartridge (under the casing) which is visible by tilting the game or just taking the back off; the very sad way to figure out the game is a fake is having the save function just not work at all (note that Emerald does not need the internal battery to work to save the game. The internal battery just determines certain in game events and anyways that can be replaced). There isnt any way to tell if the game is fake or not until you have it in your hand (seeing as online sellers can use real images from anywhere and state they are theirs) and when purchasing its purely based off of trust.
 if you order a gameboy cartridge like this game it will be able to work on the ds gameboy slot they are the same
 You can play it on the gameboy advance, gameboy advance SP, nintendo DS, or nintendo DS light
 I would say yes. Its like walking on a treadmill. I get more exercise off this game than wii fit.
 Yrs, the game is terrific and addictive. My grandchildren and myself really love it.
 Absolutely appropriate for children! G-rated and fun for kids and adults. Great program.
 Yes you can. I use my Walk It Out in my WiiU every day.
 I did not know Walk it Out was supposed to have mini games, so I look forward to hearing from someone who\s played some.

 I don\t use wifi for the DS. There are TONS of games that you can play against the  computer  and/or single player games.
 WOW. I purchased this game for my nephew a while back. I believe this was for the regular DS game. It worked fine. I dont see a reason why it shouldnt work on yours. You can also ask the seller if it will work on your DSi XL. Hope Ive been of some help.

 Its a toggle switch up an down only and not similar to actual flight flap system. I still prefer using m joystick lever for flaps
 You have to download a plug-in from X-plane.org. Install in plug-in folder. Activate the plug-in.
 I doubt there will be conflict between the two. I once had two controls for the flaps, one on the panel, one on the throttle quadrant. Youd just have two controls for one thing. Plus in Flight Sim it splits the different controllers into categories, so it may do that for your wheel.
 Yes mine did but it was very easy. Install the disk and device with the disk. Go to www.saitek.com click on downloads on the top bar, click on software, then select the product Pro Flight Range from the drop down, then select the Pro Flight Multi Panel from the next drop down. Then select the type of OS 32 or 64. Finally select driver download and make sure you click save then you are ready to go. You can also get the Drivers for X Plane 9 and 10 here on the same site and page. IF you need to update more than just select make another selection on the same page.
 Hello, As long as the latest Xplane drivers and plugins are installed prior to connecting the radio panel then yes it should work.
 COM1, COM2, NAV1, NAV2, ADF, DME, or the Transponder Code (although Ive had difficulty getting the transponder to work). Adjusting things on this panel while in-flight updates them on the in-game virtual radio stack and vice versa. Hope this helps.
 It will 99 percent work in win 8 I have x plane and u had to download a plugin but it works great
 Yes. Use the xsaitekpanels plug-in available on the X plane.org site. I have had no problem switching the radio channels or the navigation channels. I havent tried the ADF or DME function.

 Yes. This is the same cable Im using for my mk1 genesis
 RF switch from AV to coax will work.
 No
 Hmmm im not rly sure, I javnt seen the cdx, I do know the outlet in the back was NOT at all the same as on the cord and its the sega genesis 1 as well. Look very closely at pictures of.this cord and see if the back matches perfectly, I swore this did but I was wrong
 R/L 1 is linked to R/L 4 which is located where your middle fingers rest right underneath the controller (that is if you don\t set them to be anything else) and I had set them to R/L 2, so R/L 1&4 and R/L 2 became swapped. I had trouble learning how to do it but it\s all in the instruction book, just a little confusing to learn, plus it remembers it so next time you turn it on just activate the swap button (glows green on right) and it will have your saved swapped set. Btw the batteries don\t last long on it, I would get a corded one.
 Ours going to get recognized as run and drive from the get go. I had an xbox controller before this one do the drivers were still on my computer. No such luck with it being recognized a one.
 the triggers are very good and have lots of spring to them, I love this gamepad for my laptop when im on the road
 Yeah, they come with a charger and stylus.
 Yes, but action replays for the ds wont. U have to get one specific for the 3ds, but normal ds games work just fine.
 since it comes with one yes it kind of is, also it allows you to download more content and a place to save your pics and what not
 The one I bought was for the American region.
 Excelente

 No, they are two different games, however they play very similarly.
 A 19 year old will enjoy this game the amount of hours I really have no clue lotsof factors I was busy with college while playing this it took me a week to complete it its pretty fun if you enjoy other mario games a scale from 1-10 its 8 it makes you think a lot on how to pass certain stages and getting the ever so mighty three gold coins overall you will enjoy this game
 3ds is region locked. Meaning you have the buy the game that has a matching region with your 3ds
 No. It works in the 3ds and the 2ds

 Yes. The only games you cant use are the 3d games.
 yes and I recommend making sure it is off if a small child is playing. wifi and 3d both have external on/off switches.
 Yes it can play every ds game
 We cannot ship to hotels. Sorry.
(
 The one I bought was American.
 Yes in fact the multiplayer mode in COD has always been one of the best features of the game. You do need a stable internet connection though. Hope this helps.
 It will keep them very entertained but they may have more interest in guns
 Yes if you dont have online then you can play bots, there are plenty of YouTube videos showing.
 If you want to play online ,Yes u need xbox live , but if u just play campaign or single player than no u dont need xbox live
 A solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun. Hope this helped! &#128515;
 Yes. It had the offer code,but if you get it used,it its probably used already. There is also a rare special edition box set but it is VERy expensive .
//www.play-asia.com/uncharted-2-among-thieves-paOS-13-49-en-70-39ew.html
 Yeah mine had a code to access all the bonus multi-player stuff because it was game of the year edition.
 yes hard bots to play its straight
 Yes its the USA version.. The game is amazing!!
 yes
 Is there online multiplayer? Yes, 4 v4.
 Im sure its on a game card. Not sure about indian vita. Sorry.
 This game has absolutely no blood and very little violence (cartoon sword slashing and fighting of the sort) and its full of puzzles in which you could cooperate with your child to solve. Its good to develop those puzzle-solving skills and strengthen your bonds at the same time.
 It comes with a club nintedo brochure and a paper that tells you how to access the electronic manual. The electronic manual can be accessed by pressing the home button while in-game and select the ? symbol.
//zeldawiki.org/Sail#Swift_Sail
 No it is a completely different game
 It must have been upon release and or preorder. Because the one I ordered recently did not have a gold foil cover on it.

 yes
 Im pretty sure that you could.
 Not even CLOSE!!!!
 Just online
 This one is a physical copy of the game, it can also be purchased from PSN Store digitally.
 As long as you have a PS3 move camera it will work for any PS3 system.
 Good
 NO CHARGER
 Yes
 This motion is for use with the Playstation 3 or Playstation 4. A Playstation Eye camera is also required to play the Just Dance Games.
 Im American but as long as you can log into XBOX Live it should reach the regional servers in your area if not log onto XBOX Live and ask for a solution.
 Of course! 1-2 local. 1-4 online. Many game modes and many achievements. Tons of fun!
 I never got one that I am a sure, I only bought it for horde and campaign mode.
 No. English only
 No, PS2 backward compatibility was dropped after the software capability of the 80GB fat model. Hardware compatibility was only in the original 20 and 60 GB fat models.
 No
 Do you mean you can play online with people with later PS3 models, or PS4 users?
 It mite but the one I got said it came with a controller but it didnt and not only that but the disk drive didnt even work so now I have to use it for parts
 Yes but no controller
O
 The regular wii remote is fine, the classic remote works also and is more comfortable in your hands.
 Yes
 I do not know what a WII mini - but we do not have wi fi connected to ours
 Wii-mote, Classic Controller, Gamecube, and Wii-mote nunchuk.

 Yes updates and patches are downloaded once you create an account and log in. Expect at least a few hours of patching on your first login since there have been quite a few big updates since the original release.
 No sorry
 Yes. Good story line. Kicks butt as much as others.
 If you would like to play private matches you can, however if you are looking to play a game mode like war zone that is like the previous Warzone & other modes from the past games you are kind of out of luck as they have changed the mechanics of the game so much that you do not even get down anymore. To sum it up you will not have an opportunity to experience the type of game playing you are you still from any of the three previous titles.
 Yes
 No this only works on a pc or console
 This particular model is NOT a wireless headset
 Head set port.
 Yes they work on Mac.
 Yes, you can also hear the clicking of guns as they are being reloaded.
 No. It is only 1 player.
 No, just the new wii u system.
 Like any of the LEGO games you can go back and get 100% completion. There is a lot of replay value here as going back to finish the game out and find all the extra bricks, characters, cars etc. is what makes it more enjoyable after the fact. I found the story to be fantastic and obviously from my review, I rate this game very highly.
 Absolutely! It is a super fun, appropriate for all ages game.
 It auto saves. If youre in the world, youll just start back at the police station. There are checkpoints in all the missions.

 The Motion controller is more or less the PS3s equivalent to a Wii Remote since its the main peripheral aside from the Playstation Eye thats required for all PSMove games. That makes the Navigation Controller the PS3s Nunchuck since its a largely optional side-peripheral thats only used in conjunction with the motion controller/remote for movement (Notably in Resistance and Killzone 3s PSMove modes) or additional off-hand motions (ex. pulling the bowstring in Sports Champions Archery or as the shield in Gladiator Combat) in most games.
 I know you can plug them into the usb and pc will detect and charge but if there is anything that I know of that may help is the controller software called motionjoy. Best of luck. Will tell you I am not positive that this will solve your problem but a decent place to start.
 Excellet product
 If you are the only one playing, one is enough. It all depends on the number of possible people playing. Were a family of 3, so we bought 3.

 Hello, and I have played Final Fantasy XIV now for over nine months, and have two characters up to level 50, and it is superb in terms of graphics. It will soar with your system and you will be amazed at how well it is designed and how beautiful it all is. You will be able to use the highest settings, the system is so well balanced that with hundreds of thousands of players spread out over scores of servers, it has no lag at all. Enjoy.
 Yes, very well!
 It really depends on if he also plays Diablo 3 or World of Warcraft. Collectors editions come with bonuses for all 3 of those games. For example, this one would give his D3 characters special wings & also an in-game pet for WoW.
/ just the box with the game inside
 Yes it does, though I wouldnt recommend trying to run the graphics on Ultra/Extreme on anything with a less than 2.6Ghz processor same as Wings of Liberty. However you can still run graphic on High you might be able to get away with Ultra if your Graphics card is good enough.

 I havent tried it as single player but it is an option. I believe it would be fine as single player. Some of my partners were so lame I might as well have been playing alone.
 No you cant use the classic controller with this. But you can with Mario Kart 8.
 In my opinion super mario 3d world is superior but this game is still a pretty fun game, especially when playing with others.
 You can use any mix of gamepad, wiimote, and WiiU pro.

 Not really, it has some miliraries, and also eauropean
 Im not familiar with their the Logitech gaming framework. But with the set point driver installed you can customize an unlimited amount of profiles saved on your computer and the profile will be loaded for whichever program has focus. if the program does not have a profile the general profile is used. this all happens on the fly behind the scenes.

 The cable is 2 meters (6.6 ft) long, and is braided. It looks nice.
 The only way to do it is to set a macro and just set to a key on your keyboard and set the action to that key in game. Windows doesnt seem to recognize the button.
 Yes
 Yes! It works perfectly!!! And the cord is a good length. I need to get a second one so I can play head to head with people
 Nope, but works perfect in the 4 directional configuration. No complains about it.
 This controller is pretty much a plug n play controller, depending on what you want it for.. If youre gonna use it for a SNES or NES emulator, it will work perfectly as its just to plug in, set controls and youre done, just like a regular gamepad. I use Windows 7 myself, but as its plug n play, it will most probably work for Windows 8 OS too.
 Yes

 Yeah, the mouse is completely symmetrical and has two buttons on each side, the built in software should let you switch it over depending on your preference
 NO! Its for BlueTooth equipped devices.
 ?????
 Yes, it does.
 It works on my desktop running window 7, so I assume it would work on version 8. Try it its cheap enough.
 No, you can load it onto your computer and then remove the disk.
 I dont know. I really dont much care for the game. The graphics are bad and the playing levels arent what I had hoped.
 Yes
 It contains all three versions. The original, warchiefs and asian dynasties. The same if you bought all three seperately. Nothing added and nothing removed when combining the three. There is a campain story that flows through all three but Asian Dynasties is the best with the more options and the acrive online multiplayer scene. There you can play with friends or on your own against computers, against other people or custom maps such as free for all.
 yes i am positive i bought it. u have 0 worries.
 Includes I, II, and III
 Label on mine says it was made in Europe. Below that it indicates the UK.
 absolutely - you dont need an Internet connection
 Yes, but buyer beware, the left joy sick rubber WILL come off after useing for a while. I play ssbb and they only lasted a month.
 I received two controllers. They were in two separate packages as seen on the picture.

 Yes, not bad for moderate use.

 If you cant find a code after doing a code search, use the Learning feature to program the remote to the box.

 Does not require your original TV remote unless you need to program specific buttons to your universal remote.
 I dont think so but dont quote me
 Line of sight for rf devices but bluetooth for ps3 connection goes through the wall.
 Im running it on Windows 7 - But the jewel case DOES list Windows XP (and not Windows 7 - imagine that) - So I assume it will run on your XP machine just fine.
 Yes. I got it to install on my 8.1 and it seems to be working just fine. Hope you find that helpful.
 Yes
 It hooks to the back of your xbox 360 only
 Its not this one. try any of the black exterior fan styles. There was this really cool one I was looking at before I sold mine. Nyko Intercooler STS for Xbox 360
 no the slim has got a built in cooling fan in it.thank you.
 Approx 8 inches by 8 inches, it will definitely fit your 3ds xl and then some. Inside the bag is an inner pouch that will fit your 3ds xl vertically, there is a detachable Velcro divider inside which you can remove to fit you 3ds xl horizontally, the additional space is supposed to be for a car charger. Either way there is plenty of room for your 3dsxl.
 Im not sure. My son has used it for his DSi and his 3DS, so Im thinking yes, but cant promise.
 The case I purchased did not come with Mario on it.
 This does not go into the xboxs HDMI port at all. It goes into the proprietary A/V out plug.
 Im not sure I understand he question but to give you an answer this cable is used for xbox only. You connect one end to the xbox and the other end to your sound system. Hope this answer your question.
 this works only for an xbox 360 that has a HDMI port for graphics, and an open slot for audio into which you need to plug in headphones, but is only that trapezoidal shape so you cant sync your headphones up without this adapter. There were some transitional models with this issue. If you dont have a trapezoidal hole in the back of your xbox, OR you arent needing miked headphones, then you dont need this.
//hdfanatic.com/2010/07/08/xbox-360-250gb/) there is a picture of the back of the Slim. The fat end goes in the A/V Port. I hope this helps.
 Its like 6 inches approximately. Sorry man.

 There is no story line to follow. Skate 3 has better graphics and more detail. My advice--spend your $40 on Skate 3.
 Ive had my keyboard for probably about a year and I have not noticed any of the keys showing wear. I use it daily.
 Unfortunately no, I was pretty disappointed.

 There seem to be some compatability issues with Windows 8. Firstly, make sure you are using the correct software (32, 64 bit); it is available for download from Logitechs website. 32 bit is included on a CD with the keyboard. Make sure to completely uninstall the software to ensure a clean install from the manufacturers website.
 Yes it is. What isnt made in China lol.
 They arent very long. We have to sit on the floor to play or pull a chair close to the game system.
 i havent noticed any noticeable delay.this system is very glitchy, keep in mind that the games have age as well. this system is cool but very, very poor quality.
 open-ended
 Ours works perfectly.
 Hello, You need the cartidges to play. It does not come with preloaded games.
 You have to go to the manufacturers website, and download a patch. Mine worked fine after that.
 It should work with double deluxe, so should your old copy of pets. Im not sure why your original copy of pets didnt work tbh. If you have further questions or need assistance from some real Sim experts try modthesims.info They have faqs and forums where you can get answers about your Sims games.
 No you have to buy the Mac version of the game
 NO!!!!! None of these games have the same system connection to play on a Windows 8,laptop or PC. I have tried and had to send the games back.
 It comes with only one battery.
 This is a rechargable battery. You will either need an Xbox 360 recharge base, or a play-and-charge kit to recharge the battery; both sold seperately.
 Yes
 I can say mine did and I have a couple of their games to include mario partys
 Yes I does and your better off with it than the wiimote
 Yes, there are. For example, Xenoblade Chronicles.

 1. Microsoft doesnt want any online codes being sold for much cheaper than theyre selling them, so they maintain pretty strict control over the price (i.e. its the same everywhere). 2. When retailers sell the physical cards, they typically sell it for the card face value. Since they have inventory and distribution costs for this and still want to make a profit off of the sales, Microsoft still has to sell the cards to retailers at a lower price, say $20 less. 3. Amazon or its vendors get a similar deal as brick-and-mortar retailers on these cards, but they have lower costs than brick-and-mortar stores. So they can afford to sell these cards at a lower price than face value, and it ends up being lower price than the online codes. The economic incentives are all wrong here, and sadly until Microsoft and other vendors properly take this into account, there will continue to be wasteful distribution of physical cards when selling an electronic code is better for everyone.
 Online game code just gives you the code rather then shipping you the physical card, so if you want to play right now rather then wait 3 days or more then do that.
 You can have them share an account. Only thing is that you cant have them both signed in at the same time, so if they wanted to do 2 player online then it would be better to have 2 online accounts

 Yes, it will play gamecube games. It will play anything the original drive would.
 I\d have to say no on this one. This is for the regular Wii units. The Wii U is Nintendo\s next gen system. Other than the compatibility issues the form factor of the Wii U is different from the Wii.
 Its compatible with all models. This drive is capable of reading the medium but there is no player. Wii does not include DVD playback software. You can only play video DVDs on a modded unit.
 This is the complete drive. You simply swap the old one out with this one. All drive components are included.
 I cannot say for sure whether it will our not, but I will tell you that the drive I got only worked for about a month before it went out.

 The mouse has a glossy finish, so is the mirror version, although is not indicated in the product name.
 ofcourse
 Fairly light mate. This mouse is cheap and durable. This mouse is not heavy like other gaming mouse.
 I use it with the newest version, OS X 10.9.2, and it works great. Plug and play right out of the box.
 Absolutely, I do this all the time. You just have to set up player 1 and 2 for each side...button wise. Sometimes changing the usb ports jacks up the settings but most of the time, they just work.
 Options --&gt; input. Select Pad 1 and allocate the movements. Push down for down, select for select etc. Hope this works.

 You just have to make sure ur wii has american system i think if its british this would not work this is from my experience Im not sure if its true or not
 No it doesnt. You can only use the Wii remote. You can either have it turned on its side, or have the nunchuck hooked up to it.

 You can play all Wii games on the Wii U as long as you have the wii remote. You cannot play Wii games on the Wii U gamepad, though.
 You can play with just the remote

 Only the subtitles. The language is only English.
 Yes you can
 You dont need to download anything, its all there you just have to beat the game a few times to find the stuff, and Gold has way more stuff then the first released version of the game.
 Electrical outlet, yes. This unit comes with a small amp box that requires you to plug in power. There are two additional wires, one TosLink optical cable to go to the back of the xbox360, and then the actual wire to the headphones. The headphones can be disconnected from the amp box, and adapter wire put on the end of the headphone wire, and you can plug them into your PC via the normal 1/8 inch headphone/microphone jacks. Older xbox 360s with the removable HD have the optical output on the big plug that delivers video and sound out to your tv. Newer xbox 360s have the optical out on the back of the box itself instead of on the wire adapter. On our old xbox 360s, since we are using HDMI now, we bought $7 adapters that plug into the back of the xbox and have the optical TosLink on the end of them.
 It should work whitout any adapters. I use mine on the 360 but the box says it works with pc
 Yes
 Astros sound better, Trittons are built better.
 I hace the tritton 7.1 and it does have everything you need for the 360

 You need to check with a specific seller. Some sellers mention if an item is complete with case and manual or tell you that it is cartridge only. For the AGAIN DS game, click on the link for 41 used and new under More buying choices. You will see the list of all sellers and the condition of the item they are selling. You can then click through to a specific seller and use the Contact seller link to ask about condition of item.
 I have windows 8 and it runs fine on mine. I play almost every day.
 I have this disk and I was able to download both. I cant remember if I had to download one and then the other or if they downloaded together. but I have both downloaded. Im sorry but I dont have any solution at this time.
 I just answered your question,but If you click onto Scramble at the top of the game it will shuffle the game while you are playing it.
 Would not recommend this product the disks are loaded with Malware and will infect your computer!
 I am not quite sure. That is all I know.
 If you plus it a usb 3 port which is blue it will not work . It has to be in usb 2 ports only. And try to down load the software for the controller too. Some games might not work with this controller aswell. Kinobo USB Gamepad for PCs XP/Vista/Windows 7 and be fine. I got win. 7 and 8.1 and it work with no problems at all. I use it for driving games like for all NFS games.

 I cant speak for Macs but this is the first and only product I have returned to Amazon because it didnt work even for a PC so I cant imagine it would work for a Mac
 No, the sound card only shows up as a Microphone In (under recording) and as Speakers (under Playback). Sorry, this doesn\t sound like the the sound card you\re looking for it seems.
 I use mine on a Dell Windows 32 bit machine running Windows 7
 If the speakers work with your Desktop then the sound card and the speakers on your desktop are working fine. If for some reason the speakers do not work on the HP Laptop then I would try to plug in head phones, if they do not work either then its a good possibility that your sound card is bad or misconfigured. The Turtle Beach Audio Advantage Amigo II will likely allow your speakers to work with your laptop. I did the same thing on mine and its much cheaper than sending the laptop to a shop to get the soundcard replaced. Let us know if it works for you.
 Yes, the usb plug provides both audio input and output functions
 Yes it does, I use it on my PS4 and my PC
 Im not sure, but Im doubtful of Android compatibility. While the 3GC is a good Direct Input (D Input; Logitech and most generic) gamepad, it doesnt feature Xinput (360) compatibility either.

 Chimchar is the only one in that game. The others will have to be traded or hatched I believe.
 No it does not
 Yes, it is.
 I believe so, I bought both Pokemon Hearr Gold/Soul Silver on Amazon, both brand new, and I do believe I saw the code in it. If the game is brand new I see no reason for there not being a code. Either way owning this game is a great choice.

 It does not work with pokemon bank but it works with poketransfer which is a partner ap. You download poketransfer for free, put any pokemon you want to transfer into box 1 of you PC, then they get transfered into the pokebank transfer box. From here you can move them from the transfer box in pokebank to your Pokemon X, Y, Alpha Saphire, or Omega Ruby game. Once placed into the transfer box you can NOT get them back onto your Heart Gold version. It\s a one way transfer. Hope this helped!
 Yes
 yes.its not a very good game.
 Yes it should work with windows 8. I still enjoy this sim. Its not as complicated as some other air combat sims although some missions seem impossible to win. Enjoy&#128077;.
 There ar 3 options arcade , realistic And simulation
 Yup.....
 Yes, unless it is a xl 3DS
 its curved a little and I dont know the exact dimensions but I can tell you that he puts his dsi in the soft sleeve and his charger in the same side and his MP3 player. The back side holds 12 dsi games and not alot more. It is about 2 inches taller than the DSI game console. It is about 2 inches wider as well. The straps are sewn well and its easy to take with on your wrist if you need your hands for other things.
 No, it does not.
 No it will not.
 fits real tight. I returned it
 No
 Yes
 Yes it works okay if the screen is smaller they look kind of squashed if its a 15 inch screen but you can install it and it will work. Ive been using it.
 I dont know what the JC means--but yes, you can play it on your windows 7--that is what I have.
 I bought the game and it is installed on my computer. I didnt download it.
 It depends upon your specific system resources. SH5 requires a powerful CPU and GPU. The recommended system requrements are closer to what the minimum requirements really are. The community at the Subsim forums has plenty of threads addressing the nuances of SH5 as well as mods to address what Ubisoft would not let the developers finish before release.
 Yes. It ran fine for me on my windows 8 laptop.

 The Rat 9 that i bought the other day just came in, its 5600DPI. Pretty misleading product page.
 4.5 inches from front to back (length), 3 inches from side to side (width), and 1.25 inches tall. The palm rest extends to make it almost 5 inches long but does not affect mouse to desk contact length.
 Very durable.My son uses it for gaming and keeps it connected to the computer, and the rest of the family uses it as an everyday mouse.
 It was probably just the other black piece that holds the weights in, if the tool holds them in then I dont really see a problem.
 old post but it does have clicks between each scroll both thumb and normal scrolls do and the normal scroll middle click is a little harder then a standard mouse but i like it its not to hard to press but enough to prevent accidental hitting of the button when scrolling.

 No she isnt. I dont think she is even mentioned.
 5(L) x 2.76(W) x 1.73(H) in / 127x70x44 mm
 might a bit too heavy for graphic design. I find that playing with this kind of mouse for hours tires my hands a bit.
 If you get the left-handed edition, its great!
 Actually it can. It installed easily and quickly without any issues. I\ve played this game on my iPad and the only difference with an 8.1 touch laptop (Acer S7) was that when you plant a plant you have to quickly double tap it to get it to stick in place. That\s not an issue if you\re attentive. Other than that, good to go and IMHO better than buying a download with many of the intrusive issues that seem to go with that. Enjoy, a great game for all ages.
 Yes, it does.
 yes I think its abetter game for alarge screen I phone
 I think it should. I dont own an xbox nor have I used one recently, but if the xbox has a USB port then it should work.
 For me all i did was plug it in but i waa usibg it for my xbox

 Im sorry I dont have a Wii I have the xbox 360 and ps3 for this. My apologies. Sorry I couldnt assist you.
 There should be a read.me file on the disc. Also look under options. This is a very intuitive game. You have to have patience with the putting. Difficult to learn the pace of the putts.
 I bought this game when it first came out. Ive run it with an AMD card installed and on a computer with GEForce GTX 780 Video card, Win 7 Professional, 64 bit processor, and have never had a problem with the game crashing. R

 There are different kinds of KFs out. I assume no. But the caps feel awesome, and also add a little height to your sticks. I hope this helps!
 these mainly just add comfort to your origonal thumb sticks, they do not add height

 The mouse comes with software controlled acceleration via a razer client, and a couple hardwired sensitivity settings on the base. You can disable the software accel, I dont know offhand what the default is but the client is easy to use.

 Not good at all. Plus the console played less than 20% of my games.

 Yes, to me its worth it. Theres a ton of games. With PS+ you can download games from PS1,PSP, VITA, etc.. If you have PS+ you get free games every month to keep if you keep your PS+ subscription current. After a few months of free games it pays for like half the cost of the VITA. Make sure you get a memory card if you will be downloading games. Or buy a bundle with a card. Some VITAs dont come with a card, like the regular Wi-Fi version. I have an 8GB card with a few games on it and theres still room left for at least a couple more. Hope this information helped!
 Even if it is in Spanish u can always change it to English just go to settings
 If we bought from thr same person I its the original vita with the mystery port
 Yes you can connect a ps vita to a ps3 and no you can not turn off touchscreen
 Yes. I think we need to get used to these on line platforms. I dont think they are going away any time soon. I have accounts at Steam, Origin, and U-play.
 Yes, but you have to install steam preferably
 Im using windows 8.1 pro and the game performed very well no problems. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did!! Hope this helps.
 Unfortunately YES.
 Dont know. Ive only played it solo.
 Yes. As long as the previous owner doesnt have it coded.
 Yes, you can buy an internal hard drive and install to the console, also works with some external hard drives.
 a game might show two wii controllers to indicate that two controllers can play at the same time.
 No its not if your looking for a xbox360 slim just search it up
 This is the latest model of XBOX 360, other than the XBOX ONE, The size of the unit is about the same size a a Direct TV cable box.
 It is a hard copy. Nothing special. Just the three disk and 2 papers, propaganda. The manuals are digital inside the disks.
 Correct. And they are all incredible.
 5.3G minimum (for PlayStation 3)..but to be safe I would keep more than that free because it doesnt specify if thats for one game of the entire trilogy.
 The mass effect trilogy is mostly a single player experience although mass effect 3 does have a multiplayer survival that is up to 4 players.
 You are going to get the same vibe with mass effect as you did dragon age story wise and rpg wise. But the combat is much better in mass effect than dragon age. Mass effect 1s combat is kinda clunky. But they improve significantly in the second and third game.
 Yes. But I never received the game that comes with the system
 Mine did
 NTSC
 Yes
 yes it has a 250 gb removable hard drive and the 4 gb internal.
 I bought it around June. Maybe July. Cant remember the exact date. But I have yet to have a problem with it.
 No hard drive
 You have to buy the turtle beach adapter and plug it in the spot right above the HDMI but yes.
 Yes it can work on the Xbox one, in order for it to work you have to buy the and xbox one adapter for the headset
//www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/cables-parts/ps4-chat-cable/464. Also note that although the newer turtle beach are dual band (i.e. PX51), this version is single band and can get a good amount of interference with WiFi signals. I had to use a LAN cable with my PS4 as I received too much interference when using the WiFi for the system.
 Yes you can, if the tv have bluetooth, everything with bluetooth you could
 I havent experienced that but like you said if there is no audio they do turn off sorry I couldnt answer your question
 Yes, a tower/headset holder.

 As a matter of fact, it does =)
 Yes it does.
 There is free drive, where you can just drive with your friends, but its not an open world.
 This is the regular edition
 Sorry I cant help you there, I dont have a Kinect. Try cheat code central, there are a ton of experienced users there.

 Battlefield bad company 2, was an awesome game. Enjoyed it way better than I thought. So I bought battlefield 3. That game was great and intense, I really liked that one as well. If I had to choose between the two its a hard call. With todays gadgets for war and to match call of duty Id go with battlefield 3. Just stay away from battlefield 4, Geez a waste of money and time.

 It depends on how much space you have on your console. If you Dont have a lot of space on your console then dont do it. If your console has a lot of space then maybe. Dont just fill your hard drive completely or it would cause some lag. If you found this helpful then great. If not I am sorry for wasting your time.
 I dont know. I dont play the multiplayer part of the game.
 Yes. When bought in store they normally come with the game console, cords, and 1 controller.
 Yes you can
 It works 100 % as expected, but when i purchased this slim i got the newer 360e, i wanted the slim cause it has more usb and is a bit quiter than the e, but other than the false advertising which amazon was pretty unwilling to fix, this xbox works with no problem.
 No
 I honestly do not know. Its a regular Xbox. Not slimmer than my other one. Im sorry. I bought it for my 10 yr old. Im not to game console savvy.
 Cant help. the label that has the key is so faint it is blank. The whole thing is useless!!
 I dont know. I bought this game for my son and he couldnt play it because it is not compatible with our new computer, its an older game. Please make sure your computer program is compatible before you buy the game.
 My son only has the Gold Edition and plays it just fine.
 idon,t know hven,t played that game in a while.on line is fun thogh.it should be still alive
 Not sure what your processor or memory capability is but I used an 8800GT video board and the game worked fine. Game play is above average to good.
 In short - no. There are still a few private servers scattered about here and there but its officially dead in the water.
 I use Logitch Extreme 3D Pro and it works for me. Cant get the throttle to work on the joystick, but the key board works for that. Hope that helps.
 Both
 No, it was just the chatpad.
 Yes, where the chatpad and headset are is see-through plastic and the rest of it is the original box.
 I honestly dont know. But this one didnt even work on my box
 The manual says its only for the xbox 360.
 Yes, I use it on netflix all the time. It works well. The mic broke like 3weeks or so. Didnt last long, but I mainly bought it for the pad.
 No.
 I play with the regular xbox controller and I love it. Why would you need a steering wheel? Just use your normal controller...
 No. You just need Xbox Live to play against other racers and post your special achievements.
 No, just for Rock band 3
 Yes.
 Highly unlikely. As far as I know, the Mustang PRO guitar is only compatible with Rock Band 3. It isnt even compatible with earlier versions of Rock Band, let alone games from a different series.
 Yes but you will need an adapter for it
 have not use it with these but that being said I use it as midi connection the dongle has not been a factor. it will work with native instruments like contact, core player etc. the only thing about the guitar is it has a sustain about it, when you make a chord you can`t mute it with your hand by touching the strings like a real guitar. I have seen a few videos on youtube abut the guitar use check them out. it`s fun to play with. hope this was helpful,have fun jerry
 Yes, you can transfer any memory to all 360s. (Arcade/Pro/Elite etc.) It is possible to transfer data to slim from any old 360 as well too. The only problem is slim to slim HDD, and thats because the casing is built different. This old transfer cable will plug into a slim 360s USB port, but the other end will not fit into the hard drive. There is slim adapter for the fit of the the newly built casing, but money and time can be saved when you take apart the old 360/slim HDDs. Then you can place the old hard drive into the slim casing and screw it back together. Thats just a shortcut I would take if I dont need any further memory yet.

 No. The transfer cable powers the new hard drive while transferring.
 Bought mine 5 months ago and it came with one.
 It actually does strip the HDCP content, I record HDMI with HDCP and without the splitter I cannot record, with the splitter I can!
 Mine did not work for anything,wasted money.
 no idea
 I am not sure how you intend to use it with Chromecast. Are you intending to split the signal received by the Chromecast dongle? I would assume that it would work fine but I could be wrong. The Sanoxy unit worked well the HDMI output of my receiver to take it to two TVs.
 Yes, both will receive the signal being sent out by the Directv box. I currently have it setup with a 3d projector and a standard hd tv. I am running standard hd to both. I have not tried turning on the 3d since I never watch anything in 3d.
 Yes they are but if u are playing fps games I dont suggest this controller the gun shoots way after u let go of the trigger just a heads up
 GameStop or a game store
 Dont even bother buying this controller I bought it and when I received it, if never turned on or even worked at all its a waste of money
 No its wireless make sure the sensor is properly plugged in to the usb port, it may also just need to be charged
 nope.
 According to Logitech it is 1.8 meters which is 5\ 10

Im sure they are on the cd provided too. If not, you can just get them off the site.
 nope

 It Does
 if you switch it to Xinput it works just like a 360 controller. If you use Direct-input, it Works on a PS3, but im not sure about PS4.
 Im not sure about the sega games but it has x input and direct input,which means the older games you can map the buttons to play them .The button mapper in on the cd that you get with the controller,hope that helps.
 Yes it will work on Steam providing that the game have support for controllers. For games that is on Steam which do not have controller support you can use an emulator like Pinnacle Game Profiler. You can go there website at pinnaclegameprofiler.com and download a thirty days full trial of the software to emulate games on Steam which do not have controller support. As to your second question...There is no dead-zone problem with this particular gaming device unless you bought it faulty or if it has taken a bad fall from you or someone else. One thing though as any other product, overtime as you put pressure on the analog sticks they will start to come of the dead-zone but that my be years from now or months from now depending on how often you use it for gaming. Sometimes lets say for e.g. a first person shooter game if you need to do some quick running or looking around and the tension in the game will have you putting pressure on the analog sticks, so that in itself will, after time throw off the dead-zone.
 Yes
 The headset will work on Mac. However, you cant have the 7.1 software on your Mac, and therefore, you cant have 7.1 in your headset. Stereo and mic will work just fine, though.
 As a game developer, I use these headsets religiously. They are not the best quality, but compared to 90% of wired headsets near the same price range they are just as good. Only problems I have with the headset is the boom for the microphone. The elbow that attaches boom to the left headphone is made out of plastic and if dropped on that elbow it will break with ease. (I strength my headsets by attaching 38 gauge aluminum with some liquid steel adhesive, to the elbow join) I have used a number of these headsets and currently own three. Two for work and one for home. Being able to get up and get a drink or rush to a project meeting, without stressing about tripping over a cord or ripping the USB out is hard to beat. Hope this review helps, if you have any questions about the headset let me know and Id be happy to answer them for you.
 the size is almost as big sennheisser hd 650, maybe you can use that headphone case
 The cable that plug into the headset serves only as a charging cable. The end of the cable is also marked with a battery icon. Removing the USB wireless receiver from the dock also disconnects the headset even when the headset is plugged in via the cable. This headset sends and receives audio over a wireless connection, so NO IT DOES NOT. The other answers are talking about the charging cable. Ive been using my G930s for just under six months and havent experienced connectivity issues not caused by myself. Ive knocked the dock off my desk and it disconnected momentarily though immediately reconnected. disconnecting and reconnecting the USB receiver reconnects just a quickly (unless the driver crashes. You can manage to restart the G930 software and it will fix the issue though it isnt always your friend.). Issues might occur if one plugs the receiver into the back of their computer. I have my receiver in the dock on top of my desk. I greatly recommend this headset.
 Yes. I purchased this product though and it did not work, it would hook up to the TV and turn on but it would not read any games I put in it. I tried multiple games none would work.
 No, you will need a converter
 Yes.
 POWER BUTTON BROKE AND WONT WORK
 Some of my games work and some dont. I think you should try to clean the cartridge. If it still doesnt work, i dont know.
 go to your local Walmart or Target. They might have a 360 style controller for the ps3 might cost you a bit though. maybe 30 or 40 bucks.
 3.55 was a long time ago, I believe it was the first major geohot exploitable firmware but to get one of those youd have to buy one that specifically has one. You can downgrade to 3.55 on certain firmwares but not the current one
 No none of the playstation 3s in production are able to play ps2 games
 Im not sure what you are asking, but our family really likes this particular PS3. Works great and was in excellent condition.
 If you download them from the playstation store, then yes, i believe so. The store may not carry the games you want, however. Otherwise, i do not believe the system is backwards compatible. Therefore it cant play the disks.
 You will have to check if the software is compatible with windows 7. I had use the software on an older version of MS Windows XP or 98.
 i can not say for sure.
 Well if Im not mistaken,I think theres a warranty you can get from the store but I believe that is only available if you purchase a brand new ps3 & it has to be within a year too. Ima check to make sure though
 The model number is CECH-3001A depending upon which release of the console the model number will vary.
 yes
 yes
 open-ended
 Yes, but it a lot harder than the normal zombies. You get hit once and your dead. There are different maps, no perks, no pack a punch, no revives, and the prices for things are jacked up high. But its pretty fun but not worth $20. Try to find it cheaper.
 open-ended
 Its a campaign, and then theres a killhouse. Yes with bots.
 You do not need wifi to play Black Ops for the DS. Any DS can play this game. The Wifi connection is only used to play against other players around the globe. Without the wifi, you can still play with a friend nearby (your friend must also have the game to do this) or by yourself against the computer players. I have not played Black Ops DS with Wifi or a friend and still had a blast (on the regular DS).
 Yes! I puchased my code about a year ago and altjough I found it difficult at first to install, (read the reviews, my instructions on how-to are there if you need help) it has worked perfectly. The game is still on my Wii, has never ever crashed and I still happily play occassionally.
 You have to use the classic controller. Its a few bucks
 I would guess yes. Ive never done it but this game absolutely will not work without the classic controller
 Yes it works on wii and wii u

 It will play any true NES, SNES or Genesis title, Castlevania included.
 Yes you can, works great!

 Long as your flat screen TV has RCA inputs it will hook up. I have a Samsung but it is about 7 years old. No issues using RCA inputs. Wireless remotes are the big issue. Stock up on remotes. Each systems games need to use that systems remotes unfortunately.
 There are Indeed a few sega games that do not work with this console. If you search the internet there have been many attempts at compiling lists of Incompatible games. I believe it is something to do with a chip (fx?) used in some game cartridges at the time.

 Yes
 Yes, it will work. The buttons are not in the same position as original N64 controller so takes some getting used to. I am not sure if this is because it is a generic controller or not. Possible non issue if go with brand name controller.
 No
 it plugs into the normal wii remote, so its wired to that but not to the console
 3 feet. But it plugs in to your wii remote.
 Friend or Foe, but that game is for younger kids than this one...hope that helps. This game by the way...is really good...my kids love it.
 No she isnt. I dont think she is even mentioned.
 Supposively they are Cherry blues, but they fail so often in this keyboard that Im not convinced this information is true. Had three of them, all three had their switches fail after about a month. I have three other keyboards with Cherry switches and none of them has that problem.
 No, this is the non backlit one. the blue razer icon is lit though
 Standard Blackwidow Ultimate has only blue with five intensity levels. There are other versions that give other colors (Dragon Age 2 with red and Battlefield 3 with orange), but each keyboard can only give one color at a time.
 The space bar issue is one that can occur to the space, shift, keypad +, keypad enter and keypad insert keys. The problem is that underneath said keys there is a thin rod running across with 2 little plastic parts holding the rod onto the key itself. This supports the wider key size, but when one of the little plastic parts pops out of the underside of the key, it will block the keys downward motion and will not allow the key to depress evenly, as the rod is only attached on one side. You will hear a rattle if you give it a shake. Pay shipping costs and wait for Razer to click the key back onto its rod then send it back, or just do it yourself... The issue is bound to happen some day- I hope this will be of some use to someone.
 Since they are used keboards it would entirely depend in the vendor selling you the keyboard. The black widow is pretty durable so unless they were very careless with it I would say there is a good chance they are in good to excellent quality.
 Hey Brandon, since it is a mechanical keyboard you can rearrange some buttons, you will have to reprogram the keyboard using Razers Synapse software
 This is not the Spanish version.
 Absolutely, had it for about two and a half years now and Im a claw grip gamer, no complaints about comfort or button accessibility.
 This is not a question, but what Ill try to help you anyway. If you lift the mouse off of you mode pad or desk or whatever, then it will stop functioning while you have it in the air. Once you set the mouse back down, it immediately begins working again. The laser only works when it is close to something.
 it worked for me,........windows 8.1
 It is not wireless and yes it supports all versions of windows XP or later so yes 8.1 to.
 This was a gift for my grandson who does have a Mac OSX. He is a gamer, I believed he liked it a lot and have NOT had any problems with it.

 Yes, it should work if you have the correct PC receiver to go with the controller.
 This is a original xbox 360 wireless controller
 Yes
//support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/how-to-use-xbox-360-play-and-charge-kit. Hope this helps.
 Yes it does. Simply plug and play
 The controller comes with a USB adapter, so you do not need anything for PC use! I also use it for PC games only.
 No, but you can change it. The old d- pad for the new one. It only cost like 8 dollars.
 Yes it is. It works perfectly on Xbox 360 and on PC
 Sure does
 Battery life after a year of usage and taking good care is about 5 hours continuous. I can get 30 feet+ away (line of sight), but never needed to go outside the house with it. Concrete walls will block the signal like any wireless device. Mine only charges when plugged into a device that is turned on. Id like to have 2. So one is charging while the other is in use wirelessly.
 Yep
 I doubt it. The software you need to configure it doesnt even work with a 64 bit version of Windows. Dont buy this product.
 Theres a pattern with peripherals with a lot of custom options that dont seem to work with the eagle eye. To my knowledge and experience, buttons that are added other than standard buttons from a company to both mouse and keyboard wont be accessible by the eagle eyes software. For example your razer deathadder chromas side buttons, will not be compatible with the eagle eye, same for the keyboard; but the keyboard and mouse should work fine, but remember, only the standard buttons of a mouse and keyboard will work. Hope this helps. Best to luck!
 There is wireless console for PS4 (keyboard and mouse). for PS3 only this i tried. But logically if the wired keyboard+mouse works , then the wireless should works too but not the combo one . Wireless keyboard need to be in seperate USB adapter from the wireles mouse. And make sure that wireless keyboard and mouse does not require any specific software driver installation
 Yes you can as well as other fps games.
 When I bought my copy half of the so-called included dlc wasnt available so had to contact sega - who gave me a new steam key to download it correctly. So if my experience is anything to go by, its vital you have steam.
 Yes it does
 The cd inside will only point you to download steam it does not have the game. You will then have to create an account. After that you spend the next 3-6 hours waiting on the game to download from steam. Once downloaded you will have to launch the game through steam but, you are allowed to use it in offline mode if you do not want to stay connected to steam to play the game.
 Yes it will. I have a 2010 model laptop with Windows 7, and the game runs just fine in the US. Actually, it works better than the original individual games (I got this one for the expansion features).
 It works great. If you want to map the buttons, use xboxdrv. Its in the Ubuntu main repository.
 yes you just need to go to Logitech website site and download the latest drivers for mac
 2 AA batteries.
 If you windows 8 installed the drivers uninstall it from the device manager and install using the CD and run compatibility for windows 7... if that\s not the case... try installing the drivers manually using .inf file or controller files
 Yes; it is plug-and-play on both 32- and 64-bit OS.
 Yes, I use it with 220V and work very well!!
 Most electronics stores have power cables just take your old one in with you so you can match up the specs i.e volts amps watts
 I realy dont know I was just using it for PS3. Sorry I could not help you with my answer.
 No, it only allows one of each. However, there is an extra usb connection that allows a cable to be used for charging another motion controller
 Better than I expected.
 HI, this headset is ONLY for chatting. You do NOT hear the sounds from the Game
 Being close to 1 another with the headphones will cause skipping.
 Well, these are less quality then the other high tech headsets. I think mainly because you cant hear in game sounds through them.
 Two feet. It plugs directly into your controller so its not meant to be long.
 No backlighting besides the steel series name on top, cant tell u how it is compared to the mad catz never owned it, but FYI this isnt a mechanical key keyboard the benefit of the keyboard is the switchable key sets
 No never overseas.
 We bought the Key Set first and realized we needed the actual Keyboard. The keyboard we bought had a generic key set with it, we just added our World of Warcraft keyset to the key board.
 In your start menu (no idea for mac) there is the steelseries folder. Check there and the user manual is in it. Also if you right click the steelseries icon its there as well. Did you experience any issues with the engine install after a reboot? 2 others here have had it freeze up. Good luck!
 The wii will run any wii game. It is not compatible with cds, dvds, wii u, and limited game cube games. Some wiI games such as just dance may requite a dance pad not commonly included with the system so please be aware of individual sellers descriptions.
 Echoes. There is also a place for Nintendo GameCube Memory Cards so you can save your GameCube game progress if you have Memory Cards. Id definitely recommend the Red Wii.
 It does not require it but be aware you can only use your code once. I had to uninstall my game and contacted them for help reinstalling it. He said it would be so easy to just do it online but failed to mention I had to install origin on my computer and download it and all my expansion packs which took forever! It is nice to register the game and get a origin account incase anything happens but I did not have WiFi on my computer ans played the game many years without making a account.
 I tried playing it on 8.1 64 bit and it didnt work.
 no, is not a multiplayer game.

 I dont know why not. It is about 2 Gig. I downloaded it at my cabin and then took it home on a external drive. I had no problems.
 It took me several trys for the download and installation process to work properly. For some reason it almost stops downloading early or is interrupted and misses things. Colonization is downloaded first, I figure. If you delete everything and install again from Amazon it will eventually fall into place. Extremely frustrating but it will work. Amazon should let you use the same code for a few days. They let me anyway.

 No. But there should be a Mac or PC AND Mac download available somewhere.
 Under My account go to the Your games & software and they should list your download code there. Then you redeem that code with Origin to start your download. But make sure you do it on the Origin client app not on the sim website, otherwise it wont work.

 Its a rechargeable battery. This is not like most mice Ive had that comes with a nub you plug into the laptop and takes regular batteries that last about a year. This comes with a battery like your cell phone would take. You plug the mouse into a charging cradle and then can play wireless, but the cradle has to stay plugged in. The battery charge will only last a day (several hours), and then youll either have to charge the mouse in the cradle or switch to the wired version. The battery is replaceable.
 Sorry, my mouse is not wireless so I cant answer that. I dont like to click and have nothing happen or have the battery die at inopportune times.

 Well one my best friends has that mouse. I have the original and the 2012 version so far. Really only major difference is graphics on the mouse and not sure if molten is hand size customizable. 2012/2013 standard Razer is.
 I primarily used it for gaming (just using the 1-12 buttons for 1 through 0, - and =). There is a way to Configure Razer mouse settings on Razer Synapse 2.0 but I never used it. I hate to misinform you, so I would research what you can do with Synapse 2.0 or go to the Razer website and ask support directly. Have a good day.
 It says it has a 2 year limited warranty and free online technical support.
 Yes its compatible with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.
 Sure is.
 A standard headset will connect.
 Yea
 No it does not just USB cable that plugs into the system
 It fits just fine.
 It says that, but when I tried to connect it to the WII it would act like it registered, then when I selected two player in a game, a screen popped up and told me to reconnect the remote. I repeated this 5 times and it never connected.
 call amazon customer service, they should be able to help you
 They are not OEM but work pretty good
 Motion plus is built in. You do not need anything additional.
 Ive had a lot of cables from amazon come in a sealed plastic bag, usually in an amazon box. If your ever worried its used, look at the ends that plug into the console for verticle lines. Mine were brand new, still smelled of fresh plastic. I love this cord. Been using it for about 2 years now. If you have it hooked up to 2 consoles at once, you will get an image but no sound. Just unplug it from the unused console. I use it on my ps3 and it still lets me use 1080p on my HD TV. I had origionaly bought them for an older projection TV, but have since gotten a flat screen, and still use them, dont even need to get an HdMI. I have compared the 2, the HDMI is almost worse because its so sharp, the edges are a little too cut.

 No only 360
 Its for Xbox 360, not Xbox One.
 I have them on my computer (windows 8) but I play them in windows 7 mode. So I would say yes to windows 7.
 You buy the game outright from amazon. It is not like the other game companies that charge you every month.
 Yes, it plays on Windows 7, which is my operating system.

 You will need 2 accounts. Doesnt matter if they have a xbox 360 or an xbox one. If they both want to have their own profile and play at the same time they need to have an account
 It should be on a 1 page sheet of glossy paper, or on a thicker green card
 Yes, a single account serves on both consoles. This headset will not work on the Xbox One nor will the keyboard.
 I read the fine print and only one problem may be looking at you, here it is, quote  points can only be redeemed by member accounts based in the country of purchase.  so if there\s no local shipment center in your country then the points may be useless, there was no warning/caution on the 12 month card except for this one, quote not available in all countries, see www.xbox.com/live/countries . Now onto the physical goods, the chat pad works anywhere but only with a xbox 360 control, that said if bought from a foreign seller then the default keyboard may not be in your language or preference, you can check by looking at the back of the chat pad, if in English you\re ok. Now onward to the mic, this should work on any control with a 2.5 headphone jack standard on every licensed xbox 360 control. Overall all should be good if bought from a local distributor.
 The micropoints for the xbox 360 will convert to real money and I dont know how much but I am pretty sure it will still work for you to buy some arcade games, music, videos, etc. If you buy this product you will be very satisfied once you get it. No need to worry about the microsoft points that will be convert to real money so theres no change since the Microsoft has change the points to real money.

 Audio jack but you can buy an external sound card that makes it USB if thats what your worried about.
 not sure but the mic is crap. hard to hear you, makes it sound like you are talking threw a pillow.
 Dont buy it. Mine fell apart.
 the cable directly connects straight into the xbox controller. if you have a charging battery pack it will charge the battery otherwise it will power the controller without the need for batteries.
 Yes, then it is just a corded controller.
 Yes
 No
 it is just as good as uncharted . very enjoyable& fun to play.
 No it is for the PS3
 It says it requieres 5.2 MB
 Sorry i dont know any.
 No there is a lot of older versions of this game
 As far as NASCAR 14, I dont know the answer to that. I only play Grand Turismo on mine.You dont have to be that close. I can sit down on my couch, and it reaches up to about 10 feet comfortably from the couch to the TV.
 yes and perfectly I should add,you might have to customise your controller in settings I dont rember
 Yes it does. But the accelerator and brake pedals are made of low gauge plastic combined with poor design and wont with stand a serious adult driver and will crack. Im happy with my new gran tourismo with an 11inch wheel with realelistic steering radious. And the pedals are made stronger. Worth every penny.
 Yes it does, im playing on it right now! It plays all ps3 racing games.
 Yes it seems to work with all of our games
 On The right side of the Xbox there is one cover. Open it. Place the Hard drive in the space provided, aligning properly and push it. Close the cover.
 Typically this hard drive can run faster and have things downloaded to it faster. But not much. This goes inside of the console which protects it, and its harder for this to get corrupted files, its made for the xbox, who knows what could happen in another external drive. Both external and this however can be plugged in from one xbox to another, if you recover your fakery age. The downside of external is you may need to find a place to store it when not in ise. Thats about it. Size, convenience in storage, and an ever so slight speed difference
 Pretty sure thats what I have. I know its a 360 and I think it was the smallest storage space when I bought it. It installed just fine once I figured out where it went
 Yes, it is exactly what you need for Battlefield 4.
 Yes, that is exactly what I use mine for
 The mouse is about 4 inches wide (thumb to pinky), 5.5 inches long (wrist to pointer), and about 2 inches tall (mouse pad to palm). I would say it is kind of a bigger the average mouse, but I fell in love with it extremely quickly. It is one of the best mice for gaming and I have had 0 issues with its compatibility with World of Warcraft.
 My first question would be, what game were you using the mouse on? I have found that some games just cant see all the buttons on the mouse, even with the software installed.
 Both yellow and grey thumbsticks are included.
 Its just one piece.
 Just one of each color
 I bought this in 2011, and dont remember enough to give you a good answer. Maybe the vendor can give you a better answer. Best of luck to you!

 Skyrim Legendary Edition.
 this game is in english and subttles and also just in english. It doesnt have DLC, but its a huge game, you have a would to explore with a lot of quests. If you need to choose a game to play during the year, this is the game that you will spend a year playing. its worth buying.
 No it doesnt
 I bought the game about six months after it was released, and there was a large patch available as soon as I installed it. I would imagine that several years later, thats still true and probably a lot more to download.
 It is both. You can change perspective from your characters eyes, to floating behind and above your character.
 Violence is really the only mature content. There is some blood and gore throughout though only with swords, axes, and bows. The worst part is a beheading in the very beginning of the game. The alcohol and sexual themes are very minimal, nothing like grand theft auto.
 No big deal. Do it and forget about it. No consequences whatsoever. In fact, I dont even remember having to do it.
 Nexus Mods has a lot of fun additions to Skyrim, including unofficial and comprehensive patches that fix a lot of the bugs. SkyUI, SKSE, FNIS and XP3 Skeleton come highly recommended.

 i bought it for my daughter for christmas, she just charges the hand held controllers says it works good for them.
 No, you need to remove the sleeve to charge. But they batteries once charge do fit with the controller in the silicon sleeve
 Yes in every way other than price ;p
 I dont a PS4 but it works fine with the PS3. It should work just fine.
 A google search for this answer will be your friend.
 Much better than the T300
 GT6 version when I got mine. There is no difference except packaging and different cooling vents on top.
 It didnt work at all for me
 Yep, it should work with classic games you download from the wii shop!

 A little less than arms length.
 Funny this came up. The Classic Controller broke about 5 days ago. A wire broke down next to the connector which is plugged into the regular controller. Just threw it in the trash. I think we had it about 3 or 4 months.
 hi you stay on the boat except when you atack tows preaty much automated mikesantoes on skype twitter
 Unfortunately I dont know. I did not download the game, I bought the disc. I dont think it uses steam though but I cant say that with certainty.
//theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10566 Be sure to read the install instructions especially about turning Steam updates OFF. It requires a little effort but is well worth it especially of you want to fly on line with hundreds of other virtual pilots. Good luck.
 Not off top of my head.... But google the game and scroll down, it should give you the requirements there

 Heart of the Swarm with this mouse, and it is amazing. Very precise. I would highly recommend the Death Adder 2013.
 Im not going to offer too much detail here since you can read all of the specs and the reviews, but I have been extremely impressed with this mouse. I use it on Linux and its still highly configurable there with only third-party software controlling it! If youre using this on Windows or Mac then the software is extremely configurable, allowing you to write settings that get stored into the mouse itself (there is a small bit of writable memory where they store it), and even create multiple profiles that you can easily switch between. For example, you can configure a profile for regular desktop use that isnt too sensitive, another profile that is much more sensitive for FPS gaming, and so on. I have had this mouse for a year and it still looks and functions like the day I bought it. I havent tried a bunch of other gaming mice but I have tried this one and Im a huge fan.
 The original deathadder (blue glowing scroll wheel) but the black editions is just about the same thing (just with no glowing). The old versions use actual drivers. the new 2013 version requires the use of the synapse 2.0 program. You need to create an account and it attempts to connect to the internet. you can disable the auto-connect to internet feature.

 Yes it is, but you have to buy the xbox adapter for the xbox one controller.

 Yes, and you can hook it up to multiple systems at once. I have mine connected to my PS4, desktop, and phone.
 Like all headsets there is some bleed if you have it loud enough. However the ear pieces themselves are very dense, so from personal experience, there is very little bleed compared to other headsets. I have not had a single complaint towards that issue, something i pride myself on because I hate hearing someone elses music.
 It gives/comes with instructions for how to use it with each system, including the 360. I dont believe that you need anything else for any system but the xbox1
 Absolutely, the mix amp pro that comes with it has multiple inputs, you would go straight out of the ps4 optical output into the mix amp pro and the mix amp would send the signal to the headphones, crisp and clear.
 The headset itself doesnt weigh that much. The entire package comes in a fancy box with the amplifier (for lack of a better term) and a bunch of cables.

 No, it doesnt. Only if you want the online features like the PvP and co-op you will need a internet connection.
 The game only has English audio and subtitles (or Japanese if you purchase the Japanese version. There is a multilingual (Spanish) Prepare to Die version of Dark Souls for PC though, if you dont mind buying the game for and playing on a PC. This PS3 version, however, is limited to only English audio and subtitles.
 All PlayStation 3 games except for one are region free.[4][5] Even though publishers could choose to region-lock specific games based on a mechanism that allows for the game to query the model of the PS3, none did so during the first six years after the launch of PS3.[6] The first game to be region-locked on PS3 is Persona 4 Arena... So you should be fine. Enjoy!
 I have known every game I play that when the batteries die the game does not pause. Which, in Dark Souls case, is very inconvenient.
 Yes
 Absolutely. It starts up in offline mode when there isnt a psn or xbl gold connection. Very little is lost in terms of functionality; its a full-function game online and off.

 It should since it acts as a native DirectInput device. I know it works in PCSX2.
 The one sold by Amazon does. The one sold by GPStock does not. Read my review it explains everything in detail.
//www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/accessories/controllers/xbox360controller But mine is actually 10 feet, but that include the USB break-away dongle that is on the end. The dongle itself adds 1 foot.
 Yes actually. My friend had his xbox 360 and one controller and I put in mine and worked perfectly.
 I can confirm it works with OSX 10.9 using the tattiebogle drivers. Feels just as responsive as when playing on the 360.
minecraftforum.net That is the official Minecraft forum, so it is trustworthy and heavily patrolled for malicious content. Be sure to read some of the comments before downloading something, though, just to be safe.
 I do not believe so, unless the game has controller support, the analog sticks do not take the place or act as a mouse in any situation. This could vary widely on the game, but in most cases this answer will be no.

 All ages can play this game. When in game play the game will adjust its difficulty automatically to a level comfortable enough for the player.
 I think you can use it with or without internet
 Just the 3DS, not the 3DSXL.
 I would assume so, as it is simply a bigger battery. Make sure you use the correct adapter for charging.
 The base is just a convenience, it can charge through the normal charging port still. I have this and have very much enjoyed it, the only thing that is not perfect about this is that the 3DS says it has a low battery after the same amount of time as the normal battery would have. So it will say it has low battery, but still has around 60-70% left
 I highly doubt it. The size of the battery isnt the same, therefore it wont fit properly.
 You can play with the 3DS while charging. (For me, the only way to charge it at all is to leave it powered on.) Ive done it a couple times. However, it would be a little weird if youre holding it because you would have to make sure that it stays charging and you dont move it a certain way to stop it from charging. It is possible to charge it, but for me it is a little weird when holding. However, instead of holding it, you could also leave it laying flat on the table, desk, where ever you placed it to charge. But yes, it is possible to play it while charging.
 Yes it does. My son has a 3DS and uses this one.

 Actually this is kind of like a compilation of a few levels from all generations of Sonic games, though it includes classic Sonic the hedgehog as an unlockable.

 yes, you will need 2 outlets. 1 for the G155 and 1 for your gaming system
 it depends on the seller if he or she has everything. i brought a really used up one but it works great and it came with everthing except hd cables.
 Only a customizable center badge, according to the description in the sentry listing. That description lays out the difference between all three.
 Its pretty much a portable tv in a case. You can hook up an x box 360

 Sorry but I use the mouse as the game is real simple and aircraft respond well to the mouse.
 I do not have a dongle for it, but it does not have its own power source.
 They basically work on any emulator that you can remap your controls to. I have not once had a problem using it with any emulator.
 I couldnt get it to work, period, and sent it back for a refund. Hope yours works better than mine did (I was trying to use it with a MacBook Pro) and that someone will be able to advise you.
 No it will not. It it only supported by PC and Mac.
 According to Steam, under support, Windows Vista is listed as compatible OS
 Yes. It comes with steam.

 The whole complete process is about 2 hours depending on internet speed and laptop
 You could purchase a USB optical drive. It would be just as much as the download, but you could buy the discs in the future at a lower price. Otherwise you have to pay the pc download.
 The story is not wholly dependent upon the story of Black/White version. There are a handful of things that may make more sense, but nothing particularly necessary to enjoying the game.
 We got the black version and no Spanish
 No it will not because of the multiple changes
 Yes
 Yes, all DS games are also playable on the 3DS.

 For the main Story part of the game, it is a single player. That part is NOT co-op. There are Missions and Bingo Battle that are two player. My husband and I are addicted to playing the Missions which are co-op and very fun.
 Game is out of print
 Honestly it does not make a difference. There are a few references to one and 2 that you might not get, but I dont think youll miss anything major. Many mechanics are new or changed and everything youll need to know is explained in game (or left as a puzzle for you to solve, obviously).
 Nintendo doesnt like money
 Its a very rare game thats out of production

 Yes you can. Wii U is backwards compatible and plays all Wii games. It is also compatible with all Wii controllers and accessories.
 Sorry for the late response. Yes indeed you can! All you need is a Wii console, at least one Wii Mote, and SD card and of course, a Wii U console. You can find videos of the process on You Tube. I plan on transfering downloaded games from my Wii to Wii U soon. Good luck!
 Console, controller, hdmi cord, power cable, sensor bar. No games.
 It is not backwards compatible with gamecube games, only Wii games. A GameCube game would probably break your Wii u. Most of the original wiis are GameCube backwards compatible with GameCube controller ports. The controller, not unless you have the GameCube controller adapter
 Its the wii only without the skylanders swap force bundle

 All the 3ds should come with an sd memory card.
 Yes, my purchase had come with the cards.
 No, the feature in the bottom of the system was taken away as the DSi was Relased, and wasnt added onto the 3DS
 I believe the eShop is part of the 3DS. I have a different color, but it still has the application that lets me go into the eShop.
 This is a suitable gift for children. It has parental controls so you can limit what she does, such as browsing the Internet. 3ds Internet has Safe Browsing enabled. You can buy games online, or buy the cartridges. I would suggest buying games online, so your child doesnt accidentally lose or damage their game. The cartridges are a bit small and easy to lose track of if not taken care of. Also if you lose your stylus, you can order new ones for cheap. Those are also easy to lose.
 Someday hopefully. But on ps3 I think it may only be 720p 3D. ps4 may be even better 1080p 3D. So how does it look in 3D?
 Yes
 I did not see Spanish on my game. Sorry
 No. The audio is in English and french, and the subs also. The spanish version is only sell in Spain.
 No mi amigo, el que venden en Estados Unidos y Europa solo viene en voces y subtitulos en ingles y frances, el que viene en espaol latino es el especfico para latinoamerica, una sea que he visto (tengo las dos versiones) es que el que est en ingles dice en la caratula only on Playstation, mientras que el espaol latino obviamente dice lo mismo pero en espaol.

 Not sure. I wasn\t aware that there was in app volume control for Netflix. I have programmed the control to my T.V., so I just adjust the volume on my T.V. as needed. The control has all of the buttons your PS3 control has and then some to do things such as slow motion or bookmarks, ect. in one touch of a button. However it does not have the joysticks but it does have the R3 and L3 buttons. It also can be programmed to your amp as well. You can also change the audio and subtitle settings at the touch of a button. I hope this helps.
 open-ended
 Dont think that it will. According to the manual, its only able to operate the PS3, supported TVs and Sony-only AV amps.
 I would say most likely not. In the instructions you are supplied tv codes to program remote. Theres a scan option to find the code for the but I highly doubt thatd work with a projector.
 Yes, and navigator too.
 Yes.
 Yes
 Yes, very well.
 no it is only xbox 360 compatible.

 No
 No
 In my experience, I say yes, it is. No way its not. After around ten years of need for speed gaming, Im into it now. Have you ever tried any NFS games? Because I think you might want to reconsider on this one. Ive tried it before and the steering response is a little late and challenging. Im just saying. However, the other ones Like Underground 1 % 2, Most Wanted (2005), Carbon, Undercover, Hot Pursuit (2010), World (Online), Rivals (2013) are better than this one. Give any of them a go. Youll like it.

 I think to be on Spanish u have to downdo far is in English
 If youre asking about language settings in the game. They have a language pack that comes on the second disk (xbox 360 version). So you just have to download it and change the settings then.
 Yes, there are two discs. Disc 1 is the installation disc. Disc 2 is the play disc, meaning you have to have it in the X-Box while you are playing the game.
 I would say no, I really didnt know how bad it was until I started playing it. The language and sexual references and actual sexual content, I feel make this game much worse than a rated R movie. The game itself and free play world are amazing, I wish you could edit the other stuff out.
 8gb is required to play the game. I would get this for a 11yr old. My daughter is 13 and I just bought it for her. I think as long as the children who play this game knows right from wrong and is respectful, then it should be okay. I would buy the game from Xbox store instead of amazon. My daughters game only worked 1 day. Now I have to buy her another one. I could of returned it for an exchange of a new one but she threw away the box and label.
 I dont know seems pretty cheap when I bought it I thought it was fake or something but I took a risk and everything seems pretty good works great runs great Ive had no problems good game and good deal
 I would think of it this way. You should play it with your boy and explain things along the way. Just like would you let them watch Road warriors the movie by them selves or with you watching it with them.
 Yes. It comes with both.
 At the moment, the PlayStation 4 will only play PS4 games. Unless Ubisoft Montreal decides to make a PS4 version of this game, which is unlikely being that they are currently working on the production of newer Assassins Creed titles, this game will only be playable on the PlayStation 3.
 Mine came in the actual box.
 NO.
 Hate to break it to you but you wont find ezio or Altair in these games. There stories are done. But I would recommend you do not skip. Get this first than that so you will understand whats going on. However I would get brotherhood and revelations before this one so you know whats going on in 3
 As they are two different model numbers, I doubt it
 It does not interfere with wifi, wifi interferes withe the rf signal from the box to the headset.

 Yes, it works awesomely and on my 64bit system to boot! And the better the graphics card, the better and more graphics you will be allowed to view in game, i.e. you can download a special expansion graphics pack that makes things nearly real life. So, get it, and enjoy!
 It should, however if your system is using xp and you are having problems running the game, the problems are more likely to be hardware related. Too little ram or not enough power in you video card. This game is intensive on older systems.
 Apparently you get the bow earlier in the game and a few other features, which didnt mean a lot, honestly I only bought the Hunters edition because it was pretty much the same price as the regular edition, but if there is a cheaper version of the original $10 or so cheaper, I would say that is a batter choice.
 im using win 7
 Yes. Crysis 3 has a public multiplayer option available and all platforms.
 No
 Yes. All DLCs are just extra maps and game modes for multiplayer and has no effect on the gameplay itself
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes

 No the second game has better graphics and better cars.
 The Burnings Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and Mists of Pandaria

 Basically, this just unlocks additional game play for the WoW series, youll still need the starter pack and pay for gameplay either with a credit card attached to your battle.net account or with game cards purchased at a store. It is $30 every two months for gameplay access (so basically $15 per month to play).
 Yes, they have it separated by region (US, Euro, Asian/Pacific, etc.) so that people can play w/the same languages and time zones.
 You HAVE to have internet. You can play solo, but other people will be there and, if offline, you cannot play.
 No art work, but the map is there

 No mam its not but they is completely up to the parent

 Hello. Did you purchase this item from us? If so, please send us a private e-mail with your Order # and I will forward to the warehouse for response. Kind regards, IWD
 The game is on the disc. You install it from there, but it will need to download and install whatever patches came out after the disc was made.
 Yes.
 You dont need Steam. You will need UPlay. I believe even if you download it via Steam, you still need UPlay.
(
 There are different settings to choose from. I set mine to use the up and down buttons on the D Pad (in the picture, it\s located on the top left of the controller). I think you can choose to use the Y and A buttons as well and I don\t remember what other options there were. Probably X and B would work.
 Yes
 AA batteries. Understand that it doesnt support gear changing or clutch, so youll have to work in Automatic shifting mode. It does make driving Forza 3 and 4 a lot more fun, however, and once you get used to driving with the triggers as throttle and brake, it gets to be pretty easy to do and is a lot more like driving than a basic controller.
 Yes
 No, sir. That would prove impossible. Halo is available only for Microsoft XBOX 360. I would vote to have it on my iPad, though Id guess Microsoft would have a fit if their competitor were to posses their precious game. Hope this helps!
 no single player you can do locally from your house but to do multiplayer you will need a online live card, *Online multiplayer and Spartan Ops missions require Xbox LIVE Gold membership (sold separately).
 I dont remember it being gory. I play (try) the horror games that are really gory and gross though. I think there is some blood but not major. Again, I havent played it much and my daughter isnt too happy when I play with her because I always end up killing her. I think it should be rated T instead of M because it really isnt that bad from what I seen when I watch her play. My daughter is 20 now but she has had all of the Halo games. It is a shooter game, so there is violence and some blood...but I would not classify it as extreme as the COD games (Call of Duty). I just talked to my daughter and she said its not gory.
 As long as you pay your monthly subscription to Xbox live you can play online.
 Standard game. Comes with campaign and multiplayer (includes online). Standard just means no DLC included, nothing extra.
 If you take the game seriously and dont run through it like an idiot then it should last you about 7 1/2 hours, by that i mean, using cover, scanning around, using some stealth, thats how much time i got
 SADLY NO, perhaps but its only when you killed online like in battlefield
 Yes, the hunter edition looks and plays better than what you see.
 Crysis 3 has a single player campaign and has multiplayer which you can battle others online.
 Yes it does just that the lobbies are pretty empty now. Not a lot of people play the multiplayer anymore but you can get lucky to meet a few players there. You can also arrange games with your friends who have the game too. Hope it helps.
 If you want to follow along the story lines and understand who the characters are in boardlands 2 then I would say yes. If you would like to just jump both feet into a game and start blazing away then no. If I had never played the first borderlands before playing the second it would be just as enjoyable.
 Im not quite sure, since i havent purchased any if its DLCs, but gamerfaq.com might be of assistance. Hope it helps!
 If you want the updates then you have to hook it in. But there really isnt updates at this point. There is one update as soon as you play to play online, I am pretty sure you need to be online. But playing online is5 really that different then offline, the only difference is obviously more players, but the enemies get stronger.
 Yes.
 Not this version. There may be a spanish version available though.
 It is the game itself and inside the cover you will find the code for the first map pack so you can download it for free. Not sure what LTO means, you can just google that and youll find out.
 Yup, mine came with a working DLC code. Just make sure your buying from a buyer with a good rating.
 The Maps that come standard are KINO, DEAD OPS ARCADE, and FIVE. Also with the 1st map pack First strike  included here, are an additional Zombie map called Ascension.
 Yes, you can play Zombies and Multiplayer online.
 no way this is a ps3 version ONLY, its a great great game, but violent
 No pack, however it does have a zombies node ready to play when you start.
 It comes with first strike. Still a better deal than paying full price for that map pack and buying a different game that doesnt come with it.
 yes
 Yes it is.
 It will work but it is only 1000 mA. That is smaller than the 1800 mA they came with your system. Almost all the replacement batteries are 1800 mAh. This will only hold a charge about half as long as the battery that came with your system. It will work, but you will probably regret paying twice as much for half the battery. Like I do.
 It plays fine for me after a full charge, although I dont play it very long at a time. Probably 2 hours max play time. I did drain it fully the first time after I charged it fully - and it took over 2 hours to drain, but I only turned off all power save features, and was not using any network. My complaint with the battery is that it drains when NOT in use. So, I have it fully charged, and then 2 weeks later it is completely dead. It does charge up again ok. The reason I purchased this one is that the battery has a 1 yr warranty.

 It can be played on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS. It can not be played on any earlier systems, including any DS or DSi.
 Yes they can! They would each need to have a separate 3DS though.
 It could be due to the differing mega evolutions and Pokemon. Xerneas is a beast.
 I believe it onky plays on the 3ds and 2ds, not the dsi

 Yes. Any 3DS game is playable on the 2DS. You simply dont get the 3D option during some of gameplay.
 The difference between x and y are the pokemon available. There are a few pokemon that are specific to x or y (like larvitar in y and aron in x for example). Additionally, in x the legendary you get is Xerneas and you get yveltal in y. There are also two different mega evolutions of charizard depending on which game you have. Visit serebii.net and check out the x and y pokedex to see which pokemon are available in each game.
 My friend sent me the NTSC version I guess it was because buy from Venezuela! Greetings!
 Totally yes. The game is very fast paced and easy to learn, you will have zero issues even if you havent played any of the games released before.
 you should cancel your order, this only works with a 3DS. But if you buy a 3DS, your son can play either DS and 3DS games, hope this helps you.

 Wild World.
 I feel as though age varies with this game (and previous versions). I am 22 and love playing AC, and have since I was 12. All age groups can play given that it doesnt have a difficult story line or controls. I would even venture to say that children as young as 7 or 8 could play AC. Hope this helps a little.
 Yes it does
 I am able to interact with other AC players around the world. I do not know if they are using the same game device (3DS) and game as we have in the USA. Wish I could have been more help.

 The Razer Mamba is a hybrid design wireless mouse where the charging station acts as the receiver for the mouse signal. The USB connection on the charging unit is also the same cable you move to your Mamba to put it in wired mode.
 Better battery life on the elite and RGB lighting. That also claim better wireless.

 Yes, its the latest product, got mine a few days ago.
 it is rechargeable. i dont know for sure how long it lasts because i just plug it in each night. i use it at my office at work.
 I really dont know - I have Windows 7. I will tell you that I was somewhat disappointed with Jigsaw World. The problem is that it doesnt save what youve done on a puzzle. If you get half the puzzle done & then have to leave, you have to start over when you go back to the game.
 Yes I have Windows 7. It works well.
 yes. on vista also which is what I have.

 To be honest im not completely sure i know there not compatible with most dlp projectors because these glasses use ir to work. dlp link devices use some type of flash to work. some projectors(not all) have a ir emitter. you can buy and a setting to disable dlp link, but it would be better to find a decently priced set of 3d glasses that have the dlp link function. it may cost a little more but at least you will know they definitely work correctly hope that helps
 It means those games with 3d compatable can be played in 3d mode, where u would need the 3d glasses to see it displayed in 3d, but it also has the regular mode which is called 2d. So u should have the option to select 3d or 2d/regular on those types of ps3 games.
 sit a bit closer to the emitter on the TV.
 Yes
 Yes
 $70 Making the TV roughly $342 If they wait too much longer after the release of Resistance 3 the value of the additional content outside of the TV starts to drop, making it become less of a deal. At the release of Resistance 3 theyd have the sweet spot for buyers and the potential to sell tons.
1, there isnt a standardized way of measuring contrast.
 This was going to be a sellin point for me, I would love to hook it up to my computer in the office and bring the PS3 in there as well, Hope they all play well together
 I contacted Amazon customer service and rep forwarded questions regarding the pre-order bonus to marketing. Will get an answer one way or another in 1-2 business days. Lets hope the Resistance 3 bonus comes back to Amazon!
//us.playstation.com/corporate/about/press-release/ps3-3d-display-in-fall-2011.html I really wish this tv was a little cheaper but I cant complain with what it offers. I dont enjoy playing split screen too much because of having to share the tv, but I think that this will help a lot with that. Because I dont have a 3d tv, I also feel like it would be something new and fun to me. I never enjoyed shutter glasses but these look much more comfortable than what is on the market right now. Overall, I wish I could choose a game other than resistance cause I already preordered it, or even just get the tv by itself, but besides this it is a very cool piece of technology that I can hopefully get.
 Yes, I have two different 360 Xboxs I changed over with the above unit. one had P/N X800474-010 the other unit X800474-008.
 There are a couple different models so you want to make sure you order the right one
 Phat 360
 if u bought games on line than the mother boeard in th disk drive has to be paired to the one in the x box or youll never be able to log in to e box live well x-box live wont let u log in unless the mother board in the disk drive is paired to the 1 in your x box. reprograming is extensive work, or just swap out the electronics & soilder the connections...problemed solved or u could be banned from x box live 4 life on the unit dont freak if its simple... otherwise youll just be playing dvds
 The two models do not matter, any 16D2S-09C can also be swapped with a 16D2S and vice versa, it is the same drive. As far as online safe no one can really know for sure but Microsoft themselves but you should be fine.
 X box is a Microsoft program base the controllers are soposed to work on Microsoft games...However I could not find a driver that would allow the controller to work full time on everything.....but hey I dont know everything
 Controller came to my house broken!
 Have you tried connecting it with the USB cord? I returned mine because once I took it off the cord, it shut off, and wouldnt go back on.
 I ordered this controller twice and neither worked without being plugged in. Theyre mostly defective and I suggest you submit a return.
 No
 not sure what you mean but it doesnt have SIXAXIS and the rumble function works nicely also I have made quite a few videos on YouTube with it its the controller I use the most on the ps3 I hope that answered your question
 Connect it to both usb ports and then push the ps button in the middle. If that doesnt work then push the other two buttons. If that doesnt work then you have a faulty controller and you should send it back
 Not sure, but it broke after a week
 Its a USB. A good one too.
 Yes it does. It is a online only game.
 You need gold.Its only made for online
 NO A gold membership is the same as being an Xbox live member. If you play the PC version it is free period and you can just download Defiance but if you want this versions for Xbox 360 you will need a current membership. But to answer your main question Xbox live is Xbox Gold they are one and the same you pay $9.99 per month and that is it not twice and not for any separate service.
 Yes you can create a local match to play with friends and family but I do not see a matchmaking option for a guest for the online portion.
 Probably never. They have shutdown their servers.
 no. it the standard 3.5mm, also, it may not work with cordless phone handset as you also requires usb as well.
 If you have the adapter that you can get for Xbox One. It should work. But only if you have the adapter.
 Yes. You can remove the Mic if youre just listening to music and the cable coming from the headset is a 3.5 mm standard for most regular audio services. So again short answer yes for sure.
 Yes
 No.
 Dude, unplug is from the adapter, plug into your computers headphone jack, and rock out. I use it for Twitch live streaming every day in the chat. Whenever theres a teamp speak, Im already set up because I have the mic in the headset. Win, win. Just, dont jam too hard, they have a habit of blowing out on one side (left/right) and youre stuck listening in just your right ear. Ive only had to buy a new one in the past 2 /12 years so, dont sweat it too hard. Hope that helps brother!!
 Hello! These are wireless.
 We havent had any issue. They hear us loud and clear for a foot or so away.
 open-ended
 Yes
 It has a total of six buttons, each mapped to buttons on the PS3 controller. Has alternative setting that work off of switches. Great stick, for sure.
 as of now, no. might need to mod it further.
 It would. Mine ran on a Mac and Windows 7. It works well on everything.
 In the top next to the PS and start button I believe.
 Difficult. The reason being is because in order to get artwork on properly, you would want to remove the buttons. In order to do so though, you would need to desolder the buttons because this stick does not have quick disconnects. Best option would be to look into possibly getting a laminated label that it sticky at the bottom but those usually arent great
 It is not wireless but the stick has a nice feel and clicks in a most satisfying way. I use it for fighting games but see no reason why it would not work well for mz pacman or any other classic game.
 Its not for pc.
 I don\t know about a detent; they self center, and that big dial in the center is the spring tension adjustment.
 ...not that I know, I got the cheapest from a trusted seller and no problem so far. Ive bought only one therefore I cant really compare. Mine work just fine.
 They will work with XPlane 10 (PC/Mac) the only real difference is the pedals in this model are fashioned and licensed by Cessna. If youre never going to fly a real Cessna (150/172/182) then theres no reason to go for these if the others are cheaper, the licensing is what brings up the price. They are essentially the same thing. I bought them to have the same feel as when I went flying. but other than that theres no real reason not to go with the other Saitek brand pedals (if its the ones I am thinking of).
 Yes; I got for it for use with X-Plane 10 on a MacBook Pro Retina running Mavericks.
 I use it for switching view modes in FSX (virtual cockpit / 2-d panel / outside)
 Not sure about MBP, however I do have Win 7 with FSX installed on my Early 2013 iMac via bootcamp. Everything works great.
 I dont know, Tom K. My controls are mounted on the computer table.
 I doesnt use a power cable. Just a USB included
 I have played it on Win 7, and on Win 8.1, so Im sure it will work for you. Have fun.
 As far as I know there is no way to change the tiles to your own pictures at all
 I have Windows 7 Pro. So should be O.K.
 Dont know.
 I believe its a file format for audio or spoken words. The game software has verbal comments during game progress.
 Try right clicking on the shortcut or executable, go to compatibility mode and run it as Windows 7 or one of the earlier versions of Windows.
 poker, blackjack, roulette and slot machines
 Yes

 Yes it does
 I wouldnt see why not. I threw mine away I did not like it...
 It is compatable
 I no longer have this puzzle and no you don\t need a joystick.
 Yes
 Im playing it on 8.1
 Yes.
 Sorry, I cant answer that. I have Windows Vista and it works fine on my PC. Good luck!
 Hi Danny I have not seen any as of yet jeannie
 ipads run on iOS operating system (like iphones). The system requirement printed on the box is Windows (XP, Vista, 7, or higher
 Not on this game.
 There is no complete list on this DVD. Instead you have make enough money in one slot in order to purchase another slot so thats how you will see the other games
 Yes for use on the laptop or xbox.. For the Turtle beach Charlie or Z6A head set #1 = Logitech 5.1 Game Console Adapter Convert Rca Plugs To A Single 1/8 #2 = Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6 Feet) This is what i am using for gaming out on my laptop.
 why not just buy the z6A, same thing and cheaper.
 all I did was install the drivers that came with it .I have installed on 2 different pcs both with windows 7 I have only had problems with getting them to work with music ..I have 2 sets of them on same pc and like i said had zero install issues

 Im not sure dude I have an Xbox 360. but if it has the single connection on the controller id imagine so please dont take my word for it thats just a guess I hope I helped u out
 I have no clue. Havent tried it. my son used it for xbox.
 Yes
 Yes ,but u need a dss converter. I use it on my xbox 360,xbox one and ps3
 Yes, you can use it on your PC and Skype.
 If you want to simultaneously hear game sounds and people talking to you at the same time for consoles, then yes. On PC, no.
 Works perfectly with xbox. You get all the cables you need
 You can use the x12 on a pc...it does not have voice changing capability.
 I have 2 teenage sons who say they are very comfortable, unfortunately the mic went out on them after about 10 months so they no longer use them.

 I believe it will work for up to four, although Ive only had two connected personally.
 no
 If youre looking for an adapter for your PC that will connect an Xbox One controller to your PC, you may be able to already connect it using a USB adapter made for the controller. I dont know much about the Xbox One controller and its properties but do some research before you start spending your money.
 Sure is!
 To be perfectly honest, I dont think this KIRFy thing will ever play nice with OSX. After trying three or four different mapping programs to get me some TF2 on my new Mac, I ended up just throwing boot camp with windows 7 on it and playing everything from there. Its not my ideal solution, but I just didnt feel like it was worth any more of my time to try and to get it working properly with all of that Cupertino wizardry.
 Yes. It works. I havent tried to see how much of it works but Ive used it on my Intel NUC before
 Its Microsoft, has all the certified seals.
 It controls our whole tv once we programmed it to the tv. Which wasnt too difficult. I dont even use my tv remote any more, I just use this one.
 No. It only controls the Xbox or the TV. No audio controls unless it is on the TV.
 Technically no, because XBOX One doesnt have Windows Media Center Extender. However, I would assume the power, A/B/X/Y, etc. buttons would work.
 There is no printed list on the inside. Only on the back of the box do you see some pictures with no names in 4 of the categories. In hidden games you see 2 names. Many of the games are for children. One thing I did not like in several games I could not get to exit and had to shut down the computer.
 Yes, but for some games you have to use the compatibility feature. Super easy takes about 3 minutes or less.
 I dont know because I couldnt get the game to load on my computer.
 The games work just fine on my computer which has Windows 7.
 all these games play off line, no need to be on the net. i can only assume the games will work with Vista Home Premium. the bit edition makes no difference, as long as other games play on your computer. hope this answers your questions. i believe this will be a good group of games for you.
 As far as I know after looking at the packaging and the discs themselves they are just the standard retail releases. Also If you buy this make sure to try and install the second game when the collection arrives because my Assassins Creed 2 disc wouldnt even install or autorun and its been an issue many others have had.
 mine was 1 for both
//www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=18&game=Assassins%20Creed you can find the information you need. There is also a calculator that allows you to enter your PC info into and the result is your custom answer.
 Yes it works on my windows on my windows 8 laptop
 Yeah, it worked for me!
 That Im not sure of. I just ordered the correct power supply from Microsoft. Amazon does have one though. I believe it called the, E-model power suppy. Hope it works for you.
 Heavens no. 3-5 days. Or, 1-2 days. Depending the shipping rate you choose.
 The box says for use with X-SLIM Not sure if your X-Box is considered slim or not. Mine is also black. Don
 I dont believe so but u can get an adapter for pretty cheap.
 I received brick and the cord, so I think youre missing a part.
 It has a kind of bracketed story mode which lets you choose which mission you want to do next based on difficulty and what suits you will face and unlock bonus missions based on which end boss you fight or the scores on the missions, and a 2 player mode of the same thing but with well, 2 of you instead of a computer ally, and I think there is a vs mode for you and your friends, I havnt tried that one yet, but the menu is easy to navigate even if you dont read japanese and the gameplay is kind lf addicting but somewhat repetitive, but I reccomend buying it if your a fan of gundam you will love it.
 Yes, Ive used it with the XP400 and it does work. It seems to be a simple bluetooth connector and not model-specific.
 It works with my Deltas and my Tangos with no problems.
 No. This is meant for the Xbox 360s controller, so you cant plug it into the Playstation DS4.
 This device only connects the Headphone to the Xbox controller through bluetooth. Most of TBs headsets have a mute button. Hope it helps.
 That wont even fit properly into the controller. I have both systems, and sure wish it worked that way! The connections on the bottom of the remote are very different.
 5700 if I remember correctly.
 About 5 inches by 3.5 inches it fits very comfortable in the hand because of its unique wave design.
 Left click, Right click, Left side buttons, Right side buttons, Middle click, and Middle button (Middle button makes sensitivity ultra fast) (Both sets of side buttons can be remapped using steel seriess software)
 Its lightly coated and doesnt feel slippery at all. It grips fairly well. Only thing Ive noticed is that after a few weeks of moderate use, the moisture from my hand has started to fade the design colors a little. Mouse is a beast though.
 I notice that on a different mouse that has a damaged cord, but not with the Diablo mouse. The issue I am having with this mouse is my computer doesnt always register that the mouse is plugged in.
 Yes you will have tracking, but you are responsible for custom fees. Thanks
 Yes
 open-ended
 Of the BOX? Is 2 1/4 high, 5 3/4 wide, 7 7/8 long. Now as far as SHIPPING dimensions goes, whatever box the seller is going to put it in will depend on them. Cause the shipper I got this from (Amazon) put it in a BIG box with lots of packing material.
 I use it for both gaming and regular use.
 NO it is not compatible. PS4 dropped the ball on Bluetooth. Where with ps3 you could basically use any bluetooth Mic/headset. I learned this the hard way after purchasing this. Only good with PS3
 Not sure if it is compatible with cellphones, but the overall quality is not that good... but you get what you pay for
 Around three hours
 same here low volume, but it works, have you turn your volume up in settings on your playstation? just a thought
 Yes it can connect. Can the people hear you when you speak? Not unless youre yelling into it.
 Yes.
 I have not used the codes for the game yet but it shows codes for it. I believe you can enter codes as well. I am using it for Dragon Quest IX right now.
 No. For that you will need to purchase the powersaves 3DS
 Yes it does very well worked for game I needed.
 Yes, but you will have to download the update from the website so it will work.
 Yes.

 Yes one grandson was in our office on the main computer, and the other grandson was in the living room on his laptop and they were playing together. They did use Steam to do this.
 no the dlc for game of the year includes new factions such as the Inca and Polynesians and a few more and the explorers map pack
 It does come with a code for the game. And it installs a program where you can play against other people. So I would say yes, the code allows you to play other people online, if that is what you are asking.
 If you are running windows, go to the control panel and open. open system. it will tell you what version windows you are running.

 I am not exactly sure what low pressure means. This one is fairly stiff with a clicky feel, it is rather easy to press. Although much harder than a cheap clicky $5 mouse. I have never laid to much attention as to how clicky those buttons are so I am not very experienced in the field.
 The hardware itself should work perfectly find. The software Im not sure but to be honest I never use it
 It has one single button which cycles through the three dpi settings. So no it does not have up and down buttons.
 V1
 About 12cm or 4,12 inches
 Its about 6ft.
 Truthfully this software is so user unfriendly for me that I never did get the hang of it. I bought it to improve my chess game. Spent so much time trying to learn the software there was no time for chess. If you are not a geek you might want to try something else.
 Yes, it works just fine on Windows 8.
 I dont know, I have windows 7.
 The program I bought does not include the Deep Fritz multiprocessor engine. I wish I knew where the best place to buy Deep Fritz would be (price-wise, I mean). You could try a site specifically dedicated to this brand of chess programs. If such a site doesnt exist, you could try any number of stores such as Chess House, TheChessStore, etc. I hope this has been helpful to you. Take care. --Mark
 Snippets. The company that produces Fritz has full instructional videos for download or DVD, but you need to pay for them.
 Is it a different language lay out? ?
 Yes and Yes
 About 6 ft.
 No. They just need to be plugged in and your game set to steering wheel controls. The instructions are also very good at exposing for to set buttons
 No
 No
 No
 Yes the cable works with both Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014, as I have both on my laptops, I use both since some songs can only be played with Rocksmith, so you will not have any issues using the cable for just Rocksmith, enjoy playing..............
 Yes
 No, it\s a standard 6.3mm 1/4 jack connector which works with all the guitar... It should be fine with yours too!
 Supply and demand, really... IWD
 Yes. It works on Windows 8 and 8.1 operating systems - 32 and 64-bit (laptop or desktop).
 you can but it is very low audio. i recommend anything other than this headset such as astro, etc.

 No.
 Pets adds in dogs, cats, and horses. Along with ranches, dog Parks, cat Parks. And jobs for the pets. Like working in law enforcement, spiritual hunter. Supernatural adds in vampires (if you dont have nightlife) werewolves, fairys, witches, plant Sims, and zombies. Along with magic, and other super natural stuff. Also adds the ability to have a lunar phase. I have both and they are quite fun. In the end the decision is yours. But I believe these items are cheaper on origin so you might beable to get both. I cant say that one is better than another. Look into both of them on several sites and see what they include. I know supernatural comes with some plants vs zombies stuff and 500 sim points. And pets comes with something and like 500 Sims points. Oh and they each come with a town.
 Yes
 The Origin software that is downloaded when you install your Sims 3 (may be different if you store bought the Sims 3) will automatically download this when you enter in the code provided with your download. If the download did not complete properly or was interrupted you may have to re-download. If you cannot install after double checking your install, contact the seller.
 I have Windows 7 and it works, if that answers your question. Its phrased a little funny so Im not too sure what you mean.
 That pretty much means you need to have the base game, I believe. The Sims 3 Pets is just an add-on, it isnt the game itself.
 No it doesnt have the base game the only ep that come with the base game is the starter pack one that also include late night and a stuff pack
 Only if it states for Mac.
 I couldnt get mine to fully download at all. Id recommend ordering the actual disk or going to a store that would sell the game disk
 If I gave you mine would it still work?
 It does work with Windows 8 very well with no problems.
 Yes. It attaches with screws, but it is shipped detached.
 The extra keys are in the rest. As well as the key pull it might be the seller you bought from it is supposed to come with the rest
 no
 It should be although Im not sure if the media buttons will work. If youre planning to use the USB port on the keyboard (there is one on the back close to where the cord connects), youll need 2 USB ports fairly close to eachother on your computer.
 geego octopus keycaps
 It works with Windows 8 flawlessly. There is custom software/drivers that provide firmware updates that may not be compatible with windows 8 however.
 Yes, it works with Mac. A few of the extra keys do not work, but the standard keyboard works as any other would.
 its not sadly. but it is still a great keyboard rest assured. Mechanicals can get a bit complicated if something goes wrong with it
 Yes that is correct. Thanks.
 It is NOT a mechanical keyboard. The price is the main giveaway on that. The keys feel fine though. I use it more for typing and that works well (I use the Logitech G13 for gaming). So far so good!
 No, its not.
 Yes it is the same basic mouse, this one just has the Call of Duty\ graphic on the mouse grip and comes with a mouse pad.
 It does have English subtitles.
 It has English subtitles and Japanese audio
 Which marine?
 This game is TRASH do not waste your money!
 one player,but has online multi players on live
 Its only mentioned. Unlike the first game where the Matrix changes hands into Optimus for the first time; this game focuses on the actual Fall of their home planet. Optimus stays the Prime and despite not hearing anything about a third game there could easily be one if they feel the need to make it. If your an old fan it will please you with how they molded the story, if a new fan you will love it the same. The biggest suggestion to make for anyone is to search the levels, find the Easter Eggs, collectables and just general background details that give a boatload of extra depth to both game stories.
 Ive not been able to. Unfortunately, I dont think you can.
 I would recommend for children. There is not any cussing and the violence is no more than they would see in Transformers The Movie, which is carried out in a cartoonish manner with swords and gadgets. Now if they play online that is a different story but even online everyone tends to be respectful because majority of the players are children.
 I havent found any problems w/ playing this game on Windows 8, I have been playing for approx. one month.
\\Program Data\\WildTangent\\fatethetraitorsoul\\Persistent\\SAVE. These folders will be hidden, so youll have to set the Explorer window to show hidden and system files. I would just copy the whole SAVE folder, uninstall and reinstall the game, and then start a new game just to make sure the folders get reestablished to start with. Then copy your old SAVE folder onto the new one. I did this moving the game from one computer to another, and it worked fine.
 No, thankfully this game was made by people who understand how to distribute games. It comes as a CD but it will install #3 and you will have to choose to play in the #1 or #2 story lines.
 I play sole all the time. Once installed I dont even need an internet connection or the distribution disk loaded to run the game.
 Yes it does!
 Plugs straight
 It fit in my Xbox 360 slim. I dont know which others its compatible with.
 No. I brought it and it was too small
 It is not. For xl
 Most consoles now days dont use av cables. Mine came with HDMI cable and that was it. If you have wifi its easy to set up too.
 Yes
 I had to buy the battery pack with a cord that plugs into the controller in order for the controller to work. You could also use regular batteries in order to get the controller to work, but I just went with the battery pack with a cord. I bought the battery pack from Gamestop, but Im sure Wal-Mart or K-Mart have them also. Hope this answers your question.
 Yes
 No cables, you can get them from the game store for 20 bucks
 Dear Michael, You can but it will be like a copy with extra, the directors cut is for those who hadnt played the game or dont even have it, becasue it only contains the game along with the dlc already installed, soundtrack and the videos. So if you like, you can download the DLC, watch the videos and listen to the soundtrack and by that, it will be like you have the directors cut. I hope this helps you.
 Not sure but I only think it has 2 languages
 10 languages offered. However, Subtitle only for chinese is available
 Never got that far found it boring since game plays it self and you occasionally do something try saints row mature game but excellent fun full package has lots of extras
 The Directors cut have full PS Move support, the Taxidermist DLC, sound track and videos of the making off. Greatest hits dont have any of those.
 There is a similar Xbox One title, but the Xbox One does not support use or play Xbox 360 game disks. It also requires a Kinect.
 I works with any xbox kinect successfully attached to your console
 I don\t know but I wouldn\t waste my money. You\re better off buying a Zumba video without the annoying defective fake game function that just distracts you from learning the steps.
 The biggest difference that I noticed is that the songs seem faster paced in Zumba Rush.

 Call razor you may be able to get a replacement
 Any update?
( I was in a similar position when I moved all my multiplayer saves to my flashdrive to play at friends, but the files became corrupted after a while. I had thankfully made a backup on my pc 3 months before with Xport 360. So youre saying evrything was moved from the original drive to the new one over the cable but the data wasnt there when you started the 360 with the new drive? Or did Xbox Live apply an update and the data was erased after the update? It might still be there and recoverable, just unrecognized by the 360. First do not pit more stuff on the drive! It increases the chance of any data there previously being overwritten or becoming fragmented! Best to not even turn the 360 on with the drive in. Try using fatx explorer, as it actually has a recovery tool for deleted files. If the 360 redormatted the drive entirely though, your data is gone, as formatting deletes the data and overwrites it with a blank slate.
 Yes it should.
 If you follow the instructions detailed in some of the reviews to restore partition 2 it will play compatible Xbox games. It\s pretty easy to do, you just need to hook the hard drive up to a Windows computer using a transfer cable and follow the instructions.
 I was lucky enough to get one that has no issues. I just connected it to my xbox 360 and it works like one made by microsoft. Except it will not play original xbox games. Not a problem for me. It is not uncommon that defective units slip through quality control and my guess is that you might have one. I suggest return it for exchange because Amazon has excellent customer service. I hope this was helpful. It should already be formatted and ready to go. Good luck. Thanks for asking.
 I have had this for about 4 and never had an issue years i think and never had an issue with single game. I would say i have played a good 30 games on that hard drive with no issue.
 No you do not just put in the game and play at any time you can install the dlc. I know because this is my 2nd copy of the game. I got halfway through the story and this was on sale so i bought it and installed, it works fine and I enjoy me Dlcs
 Its like far cry
 Ive never played on the regular version, this is the only one Ive played
 Games Library--&gt; (rt-clk) to fallout new vegas in list--&gt; Properties --&gt; Language Tab
 Yes, the ultimate edition has the original game plus a 2nd disc with all the dlc for you to download. You would be able to use the content from the original game and not lose it.
 This will support the Virtual Console of the old Zelda, Kid Icarus and Mario Brothers. If you are talking about using old NES cartridges with the Wii, that will not work. Hope this helps!
 I received the the wii which was fine but did not receive the Skylander game. I was dissappointed about that but when I read the fine print it did state the game was not included. I should have paid closer attention.
 NO,this version does not play dvds.
 I dont know, but I dont see why not. I think all you need is the belt and the sensor.
 I have taken mine overseas, you just need a power cable for your specific country with the correct voltage. If you check the back of the machine, it supports 100-240. Do not plug in your 110 cable in a 240 volt country and vice versa!
 It doesnt come with a manual. You learn everything you need to know to play the game while playing. (there might be a digital manual on the disc) It does come with a code insert for extra outfits.
 open-ended
 Yes it us.
 I cant find any option to change the language.
 No and yes..No because its same game . yes because you know when something is new when used it can be buyers beware.
 It uses an accelerometer, but Ive seen setups where people attached it to the column of other steering wheels. The accelerometer is alright, in my opinion. Its not a high end wheel since no feedback, but its nicer to use than a gamepad, or worse, mouse and keyboard. As for games, I tried it out with F1 2013, F1 2014, TDU2, Race 07, GTR Evolution, and DiRT 3, and they all worked fine after setting the controls to what I wanted.
 It works with accelerometers, so you dont need to attach it to anything at all, unless you want to.
 No.
 Not easily. You can fabricate a mod to the G27 (youtube for specific directions). There is a mounting screw in the back of the SRW-S1 if you want to build your own mount for it.
 Yes, I have used with iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Need for Speed Shift 2, and Game Stockcar 2013. It works well but without FFB (force feedback). By comparison, in iRacing, I tend to be about 1-2 seconds slower per lap than I am with my Fanatec ClubSport Wheel and Pedals. However, I am certain that I could close that gap to less than 1 second with more practice.
 It will charge the Vita 2000, however you will need the USB cable from the original Vita 1000 kit to charge the battery. You should be able to buy the original Vita USB cable separately here on Amazon.
 Yes you can. I bought this myself.
 The battery pack itself is 2 5/8 x 2 5/8 x 7/8, I just measured it now.
 the ac charger that comes with the original ps vita will charge the portable charger.
 No
 GT5 XL adds a few special downloadable cars/tracks etc. GT5 is the full game, but the XL version includes content that came out after the initial release of GT5. If you bought GT5 and wanted the extra cars, youd have to pay to download them. GT6 has a different interface, but many reviews said that GT5 was the purer game. Read some reviews on GT6 and GT5 to see what you think.
 I do not play online but offline yes 2 people can race against each other but you have to be in arcade mode. one thing I do not like is in my game the regular version when you tune your cars power and race against your buddies your car automatically goes back to the stock power of when you got it. but do not worry just in arcade mode but in this version when you upgrade your cars and race against your friends I believe my brother said the powers the same. he gots this extended edition
 Yes it can.

 No, it loads something called Steam but the game installs on your PC and runs without being online.
 Im guessing yes, because it will be on your computer and not from a pc disk, i dont think it will require Steam. Worth a shot?
 No
 I run it on Windows 8.1 pro with no issues!
 Yes, it comes with it.
 Yes, it is
 Windows will only recognize 5 buttons. The others you\d have to program in the mouse software to duplicate keyboard keys, like F1 to F12. This is true for all the mmo mice with lots of buttons. In addition, you can program macros to each button. For example, you could program one of the mmo7 buttons to simultaneously click on the target and activate a keypress like F12 (then bind grenade throw to F12 in the game), and voila, you have a mouse-over-target single-click grenade throw. Again, you can do the same thing with most high-end gaming/mmo mice.
 There isnt any measurements as far as I can tell, but it does make sense because this mouse is fully customization. It can be very small once everything is retracted, or can be longer when fully extended. It can fit pretty much the average persons hand. People that would have a hard time would be someone whos 60 + and have huge hands.
 The mouse macro options in the software should allow you to program the buttons to activate keyboard keys, repeat recorded mouse actions, and mouse buttons. To open software, you could record presses involving the windows key, but it cannot natively open software.
 To put it in the context you suggested, Wheel of Fortune. It does not retain any real inertia, and basically only moves when you have your finger on it.
 only the dpi indicator, the mode changing button and the front of the main mouse buttons light up,but there is a gap infron of the buttons, so when the mouse is resting, it looks like a cross of light is projected infront of the mouse on whatever the mouse is resting on
 Mine was in English.
 Yes.
 This is an add on for Flight Simulator X. It is not stand alone.
 No, it only works with FSX and must upgrade to service pack 2 (this is downloaded online)
 I run it on win 7. No lags and other problems.
 Yep. Playing on Windows 8! Brian
 Hello Caleb I am sorry but I bought this game for the son of a friend and all he needed was that game in english.
 Yes it work perfectly
 Yes Euro truck simulator 2 is comparable with a G27 steering wheel.
 Yes it will.. Thats what it was made for.
 Not sure.
 I dont know for sure, but it would probably work. I would think it would be harder to overlay on the screen though, since you use the buttons on the right to line up the film before you place it.
 This kit is made for the original PS Vita. Ear buds sound great, pocket pouch fits perfect and snug.
 Yep thats what I bought it for. Works good for a thin sided carrying case
 hi, i am a seller but you need to contact amazon to ask them about if you can buy 8 and if they can ship it to verezuela, i have only 1 thanks
 It is very light.
 yes it does
 Got about 2mm extra on each side of lines up correctly.
 The XL is also backwards compatible...realized that might not be clear from my post!)
 No
 Yes this is a US version of the 3DS
 Most US based companies that produce electronics work out of China but the product seems to work fine
 No
 yes I use Windows 8
 Shelly, I Have A Brand New Acer Computer With A 64 Bit System And All The Necessary Equipment To Run xplane 10, My Problem Is Not The Computer. It Is Setting Up The Game Operation. For Instance, I Cant Get The Null Zones Properly Set For Positive Control Of The Airplanes, In Addition, The Throttle Will Not Decrease To 600 Rpm During Landing Approach, It Decreased To 1000 rpm. Very Hard To Control Landings.my Last Flt Sim. Game Was 95, Lots Of Changes Plus This Game Is More REal. I Am Going To Contact X-Plane Support For Both Problems. Its Getting Better. Thank You
 You need to contact the vendor directly. This is for questions about how to use the product or its features.

 Yes, but highly recommend you go to Windows 7. Skip 8!
 I havent had any problems like that up to this date. I was actually suprised by the quality of this hard drive because it looks like an exact clone to the Microsoft one. I know this doesnt really answer your question and thats because I havent in countered your problem. I am not going to swear by this HDD as the reading might be your Xbox or might be the HDD if your looking to buy it do it. Its insanely great quality for the price.
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360
 The one I bought had a 30 day warrantee from the seller. Did you check with the seller you bought from to see if they had a warrantee? not all sellers do this.
 Yes it is compatible with the Slim edition of the 360.
 My son has had this for about 8 months. No problems. I was worried about the durability because he actually removes it almost daily to go back and forth from moms to dads house to keep all his game data current while playing xbox at either house. He has taken it to friends house and plugged it in there to access his data, he did have to log in as himself. So worth the price. So glad we got it. No problems with DLC add ons or games.
 It uses steam as the DRM so the only difference is who youre buying it from. Itll act the same as if you bought the game from steam once you redeem the code you get. If steam has a Mac option then it should work.
 We havet tried 8.1 but it does work with 8.0.
 No
 I run it on my W8.1 laptop. Should work with any decent Windows computer - I believe that any program that ran on W7 is backward compatible with newer windows OSs.
 Indeed it does. All of CKII and its respective DLC are Steam managed DRM.
 Virtually no background noise
 Mike the X32 uses two AAA batteries. Not sure how long it lasts, but Id get some rechargeable ones and just swap them out.
 Your headset receives whatever sounds are coming over your TV. You can hear your games just as much as you can on your TV. In fact, if you need, you will hear your standard TV channels, DVDs, etc., over your headset
 Yea you hear everything..which side from behind...youll love the way it sounds when you become the predator or Michael Meyers
 Mic sounds great and no one online has complained about my mic. can hear everyone else great too.

 Hello Bat, Could you please clarify what you mean by external sound? I would be glad to answer you question as soon as you do that favor.
 Your headset would need to be compatible with surround sound. And its simulated surround not true. Im not familiar with the stealth but if it came as a stereo then this will not help you.
 forgot to mention that you need to go into the xbox one settings and find the audio section and make the optical digital audio on
 You can connect the audio output on this unit to the input of the unit for the wireless headphones and it does work. I used x32s in this fashion and it works perfectly.
 Yes, it comes with the headphones, transmitter, & the cables. It should have everything you need! If you are getting them for games like Call of Duty you will love them! Its like hearing online for the first time!
 wireless as in dont need a 12ft cord going across your room? then yes its wireless... but a 2ft cord from headset to controller? no
 2 AAA batteries.
 Turtle beach made an adapter to fit the Xbox Ones controller. The headset will work with PC with sound, but no voice support.
 Any wireless headset in your price range for the game machine you own will work just fine. The Turtle Beach Ear Force X42 are affordable and have worked very well for us. They also work for both the xbox 360 and PS4 systems. FWIW.
 Exactly. Some things, like hard drives of the same make, model and series that just have different sizes... those I can see lumping together. But these Razer mice are NOT THE SAME PRODUCT at all. A review of one is not valid for a review of another one. Amazon failed big time combining these.
 price is depends upon the availability on the market.
 The one we bought stopped working after only a few months. Amazon has only a 30 day return policy so we contacted the manufacturer and they are supposed to replace.
 Its a plastic nub that pops in. Has different sizes.
 Yes it can move to the right only
 The... XP400, PX5, XP500, Tango, X-Ray, Delta, and Phantom headsets were designed for use with PS3 and Xbox 360 game consoles. It is only possible to use these headsets on a PC or Mac if you have the correct configuration and hardware. We recommend using one of our many PC compatible models instead, such as the PX3 or Z300. I do not have the Bluetooth setup to use on my PC, so half of the function of the headphones is lost to me unless I spend extra money and time figuring it out. IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR PC, GET SOMETHING ELSE FROM TURTLEBEACH.
 Technically speaking the console has less to do with the quality of the sound, if not related at all. However the game its self will affect the quality of the surround sound features. If you play newer games that support dolby digital youll be fine. Hope this statement helps! - Jake
 Yes. The transmitter does have a 3.5mm port to allow it to connect to any portable device or T.V.
 No it cannot. The bluetooth is use for chatting or speaking with the Mic wirelessly. If you want the smarthphone to sync with music then the XP510 is capable everything
 The headset and transmitting piece it comes with has many options. It comes with an optical cord which is the main audio output of most modern gaming systems (hence why its made for Xbox as both the 360 and One use this output). The transmitter also has an option auxiliary input so you can use the headset for computers or even phones. The headset does not come with this cord but these types of cords arent hard to find. As for the headset, it has Bluetooth and a 3mm output that can only be used for controllers or chat adapters. There is no main input on the headset as the transmitter handles this.

 Yes, it is frustrating... but in a good way. The key to the Souls games is to block with a shield; so watch your enemy and raise your shield as he moves to strike. This will open them up to an attack by you. Once this is learned it really gets fun!! but remember... all enemies are DIFFERENT! Its about timing! Hope that helps! Good Luck!
 No, It has only a online mode where you can play but not in private, some player can put a signal on the floor and you can invoke the spirit of him for your help.
 you can, you can get health regain rings, the problem with the game I found not to my liking is that if you die, you start with less health compared to other games that you start with full health, the game is really difficult for me even at normal mode
 Impossible to say what causes lost connection as the message on screen does not tell you - it just says lost connection so can be any type of fault (you or them)
 Yes, Yes, Yes. I played the game for 3 hours, saved and turned the console off. When I turned the game back on all my money or souls were gone and I was back to the beginning. So unless you have time to kill, F this game.
 It depends on how good your computer is. If you have a good graphics card and processer, then yes it will run on windows 7
 It actually works amazing on windows 8.1

 No, u can still play online. Luckely you will still have 5 characters included no need any codes n u can play with your 4 friends in tag fight which is two agaisnt two as a team. This game is worth it n one of the best of all MK games.
 Well, the ome I got, come on the disc.
 No it doesnt come with any PSN avatars. You have to buy those from the Playstation Store separately.

 Officially ATT, but there is a work around to save tons of money. Most people do not know it, but TracFone owns ATT, they are also behind the Straight Talk cut rate service provider at Wal-Mart. What you do, is buy the sim from Wal-mart (couple of bucks) then get the data only plan. Use the associated website to top it off once a month, or only when traveling. You get the same network, but at dirt cheap pricing. (PS, also works great for most ATT phones, it must have a sim. My phone plan went from over $150 to $50)
 Yes you can use it with regular wifi, I use it every day without any 3g chip in it.
 Depends on if you have the Wi-Fi on or off, if you have it on its going to drain the battery. Say 3 hours or so? Without it 4 hours, but I believe you can shut off the system without powering it off completely to conserve power.
 I dont believe it is locked. My Vita when I bought it from here came with a sim card for at&t so Im guessing that you could just put another in because Sony says its not locked to any specific carrier.
 No
)
 Completely fixed
 Its more for tablet or ipod, it has a 3.5mm jack, it will work with an xbox 360 if you get an adapter
 No
 No, this isnt a gaming set though, has no chat mic and doesnt fit with controllers
 This is for the original vita system. You have to place the system in the grips at an angle. Where the top buttons are on the vita, they go in first at a downward angle, then the rest of the system snaps right in.
 Probably not because this case doesnt not leave any space
 Of course and you can easily remove or insert your PS vita from the case AT THE SAME TIME as your charging and have earphones plugged in. This case gives you access to all ports except the Sim card port on the 3g model.
 I use a kindle fire soft case from Belkin and it fits perfect with the grip, lots of protection too. Got it at target. I took the grip with me to figure out what would fit.
 No, you can still use the rear touch pad
 Its always blue.
 Yes it does and quite well.
 Nope, just the one ball controller.
 yes the eye is what the remote goes by.double check the game it should tell u what u need .
 Yes the Move Motion Controller does work on the PS4 and PS3. Tested with Just Dance on the PS4
 All parts separately and they are all original
//support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2092/~/playstation%C2%AEmove-setup We are satisfied with this purchase.
 It is charged by the same mini USB that charges the Dualshock 3. Mine was used so it did not include a charging cord. Id assume the new ones do. Also, no it does not come with a gun. But you can find them online and in stores for CHEAP.
 A lot of the games you wont be able to play without it.
 Sorry, I gave it as a gift, I dont know
 My son tried this. It does not work. There may be some usb drivers available that would make it work but we have never looked.
 No
 Yes it will just plug this cable into your controller and then plug it in your PC to update the cord and its drivers so it can be able to charge your controller on the PC and Xbox console youll know itll work once after it installs your the cord drivers to your PC the red light will come on on the cord. To play with the wireless controller on your PC while being plugged up just go to your device manager and scroll all the way at the bottom and select your controller properties and then select its wireless playback drivers for your PC to Xbox controller.
 Starting from the far left, the first one is a rewind button, the second play/pause, the third is fast forward, the fourth is mute, the fifth decreases volume, and the sixth increases it. I dont personally know what the rewind pause/play and fast forward buttons are for.
 the standard length, dont expect anything special from this keyboard, it is a bottom of the line gaming keyboard that works surprisingly well
 It did not come with black keys. This is a pretty average membrane keyboard and if you dont want orange keys, you shouldnt buy the keyboard.
 Yes
 yes works with windows 8
 Yes, I bought it on Amazon and they sent me the game but I had to use Steam to play. Steam is ok except it can be a pain in the butt to log on with their password system. The game is very good. I think if you buy the game and not the download you should not have to fool with 3rd party sites to play the game.
 Yes, It is the current operating program on my Desk top computer , the game says both 7 and Vista.
 NO IDEA!

 I have connected at least 2 controllers. I believe a single unit will connect up to 4.
 Yes, that is what Im running at home and it works perfectly.

 No. Fat version only (1000 series)
 I bought this because it is the most comfortable grip out there. I have the portable charger as well, but the benefit the power grip has over the external battery is that there are no wires if you are charging the Vita with it. If that doesnt bother you then it is just a really nice grip that happens to charge the vita as well.
 No I dont believe so

 I got it new from cheek up a seller in japan they have never let me down before so i think you will be happy
 Yes it would
 Carnival, Cash Climb, Chocolate, Dance Electric, Dinosaurs, En Fuego, Fireworks, Fishn Fortune, Going Once, HO!HO! Dough, Mirage, Order in the Court. BTW, I am running Windows 7 and this game only plays in a small window. It might be better in other operating systems but it sucks in Windows 7.
 You are in luck! When you open the game, you actually have two options for languet. You can either choose dubbed english version, or original Japaneese voices. If you choose the english dubbed version, most of the game will have subtitles, but there will be cut-scenes with no subtitles at all. How-ever, if you choose the original japaneese dub, Every-thing will have subtitles including animated cut-scenes! So when you are on the main-menu of the game, go to Settings. choose Languetes. and then choose original Japaneese voices, the entire game will have english subtitles ^^
 yes it does
 You can select the language in which the text will display and spanish is an option. The game audio can be chosen as well english or Japanese.
). In the setup you can choose the languages From English French and Spanish
 After installation it totals at 3,847 MB or 3.8 GB. I dont believe there is any updates for it though.

 yes, it says it works on mac as fare as anything else you cant read their writing nor can you understand and of the printing in the paperwork or on the box? buy it dose say it works on Windows Vista, 98/me/200/and XP and mac I am using it on my windows 7 professional
 Yes it does
 Im just using stock mouse controls and using a pc.
 Yes it works with windows 8
 It has four different languages, English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. You can change the text, subtitles and speech, and all of this can be found in the options. If you have any other question I am more then happy to help, I love this game and the story line.
(.. But I still think you will enjoy it and the game provides high awareness mode when the hero hear through walls (you both hear the sounds on long distances *and* see the silhouettes through obstacles) - so should be good to go.
 Yes. This game is rated 17+ for everything from violence and language to gore and nudity. This is an extremely dark game that is aimed towards a mature audience.
 You play as the guy (Joel) for the majority of the game but play as girl (Ellie) for a small part. You cant switch charecters though.
 You tell me man. Makes no sense.
 Yes, Its compatible. I have in running on my desktop and my surface pro. Both 8.1
 I am not selling anything, the game has drm and is tied to an account once activated. I simply wrote the review to help future customers with their purchases. The limited was a pre order special that came with a couple digital extras and a beta. As far as SimCity standard, it is the same as limited, I believe deluxe is the one with all the bells and whistles with digital content.
 yes it does work with Windows 7
 Yeah before doing so you should install a anti-virus system probably Webroot is the best. The only reason you should install a anti-virus is so you wont end up having a virus like I did.
 Correct. The other advantages of single player mode are that the space center work is not bugged and that the prices of the goods are steady and do not swing around. The one disadvantage is that you dont get achievements.
 Yes it works on mine
 Even if it did, I wouldnt get it. Mine lasted about a month and quit working. I use my ps3 about 2 times a week if even. So that should tell you something about the device.
 This will work with as many as the Bluetooth can handle. I can plug in all 5 of my Rockband instruments and still use the controllers You may have to manually program the controller numbers on some but yes they would all work
 it is account bound so all characters
1 (100 points for every dollar) a single character slot is 495 EMP or 3960 EMP to unlock all 8, BUT only for one server! Thats a little over $39. Then when you add in the cost of expanding your bank slots thats an additional 495 EMP for 1 slot or 1320 EMP for all 3, costing an additional $5-$13. So in the end you would end up paying between $54.45 - $52.80 just for upgrades on ONE server. So that in mind I decided to buy a physical copy, which will give me all 8 character slots & all 4 bank slots in all the servers not to mention 3 pages instead of 1 in the Brokerage (Players Market), to save myself money in the long run. I also decided to spend an additional $15 and upgrade to the collectors edition simply to get all the nifty extras! The review by Catpsyche really says it all for why I did. But even then I still saved money! Also just some advice, but if you are going to buy something from the EMP shop save yourself money in the long run and always buy permanent!

 The mounts are included in the activation code. After activation, you can find them in the Item Claim tab on the in-game menu; under account-bound items. All your characters can use them.

 Friends, I bought this disk. It took me longer to figure out WHERE it when, then to install it. this was my second xbox 360 experience in like 5 years. my other uses have been 4 or 5 years ago. It seems like this system the slim, adds an extra step to the save and load process. to ask you WHERE you want to get the data, your 4 mg internal memory, your NEWly installed hard drive, or the cloud. I think that step interfers with the OLD xbox functionality, so they do not work. They mean the old xbox, NOT the xbox 360. so your 360 games should all work fine, I have tried like 12+ games, and they all worked. But I never tried a xbox game. I am happy with this disk, except for the extra step the slim added. Thank you. Dr. Darrell of michigan.
 Yes you can play destiny
 From what I understand, all Slim labeled hard drives work just as well on the E systems, since they didn\t change anything about hard drives in between the two.
 hasnt happened to my son.......do you leave the xbox on for long periods? When our computer monitor had heat issues, we bought a small fan that runs whenever the monitor is on and that fixed the overheating problem......
 Yea this controller is definitely a third party controller. To be honest I bought this because it was cheap but for some reason I kept getting shocked by the controller. Eventually it was unbearable and persistent to the point where I sent it back and just bought a microsoft controller. No complaints since then.
). And how it performs? It works for what it is, if agame supports an xbox 360 controller it will work. There might even be some mods or workaround a for games that dont support 360. As for the controller itself, hardware, its great! Everything feels like it should on a 360 controller.
 i tryed and it doesnt seem to i would recommend trying to get refund if thats what got it for
 yes
 Mine did not work at all! It was plugged into an xbox 360..
 It full charges it
 Hi, it works with any battery I have the original batteries and the 2 I received with the charger and they all fit in.
 It is not nyko but I do not know who makes it
 The one battery pack that worked for a short time worked fine.
 Same here, I bought two of these chargers, one was fine..the other one had a broken brass strip on it and the battery will not charge on that side. I was wondering the same, how do I get a replacement as this one is obviously defective. I dont want to have to go through the whole process of having to repackage it, sending it out again, and waiting for the replacement. I was very disappointed.
 Yes, you can play the Wii version on the Wii U. The Wii U is backwards compatible with all Wii titles.
//www.amazon.com/Epic-Mickey-Mickeys-Paintbrush-Wii-Nintendo/dp/B008FHHT1S]
 No, but parts there are a few parts that are easier with two, but still possible with one.
 yes i think you can find Spanish in the settings.
 This game has a track that require reading, children use their logic at times to find the answer without reading, opportunities are lost and you return to previous game spaces, I recommend starting with Epic one

 Yes, this type of cable can be used for Xbox 360 chat with the Phantom headset.
 Yes, the Xbox 360 Talkback Cable will work with the PX5 headset.
 Its 2.5mm. The same size as the xbox controller jack for both ends
 Im not sure of the exact measurement but it fits into my Xbox controller just like the one i replaced
 Windows 7 requires more than 8GB to be stored. In that configuration the OS would be put on the 1TB hard drive. Are you absolutely certain you are buying an 8GB solid state and not a 128GB solid state? 8GB does not hold a lot of data in 2014. If you are indeed purchasing a 128GB solid state then the OS would be loaded on the SSD for performance reasons. That would give you approximately 100GB of usable space for critical applications/games as best practice is keeping your SSD at a minimum of 20% free.
 It works on USB. ..I dont even hook mine to the playstation
 Yes you can.
 Yes, it does. The functionality is iffy though. Mine still works but only one of the ports and its on and off.
 No, It does not. My boyfriend already had a cord to charge his controllers from the play station. He uses the same cord for the charging stand. If you have one of those it should be fine.
 This one Is really good more stuff. But I havent played original. But this has dlcs
 I dont know why the top rated answer said yes. Its a Batman game - there is a small level of violence but its very tame, showing no blood whatsoever. There is no blood or gore, and shooting is stopped by Batmans armor, and if you were asking if you play as someone who shoots people, Batman only has non-lethal weapons. Its rated T so quite frankly, any kid who is familiar with Batman is probably old enough to play Arkham games.

 Have you try the system first then the game
 Yeah, you can free roam. There are several sub story lines you can do as well.
 Unfortunately it does not. This version is English only audio and subtitles.
 Yes this game does have a diffulty option before you start.
 Probably the game is used and thats why you dont have it. But if the game is new.... it should have come inside the box. You gotta have a piece of paper with a code on it. If not... contact the seller.

 I use this keyboard with Windows 8, and it works fine, software and all.
 Good for youth very realistic I have an 11 year old who now knows how a real airplane flys and has been inspired to learn how to fly. Highly recomend
 Yes it does.
 It does come on a cd, and only on a cd
 i have an earlier macbook pro and play X-plane 10 on it. I dont see any reason why not.
 X Plane 10 may work with your MacBook May, 2006, but it will not be capable to utilize all the programs within X Plane 10. I have been an X Plane user since the old 7.5 days. You will find that X Plane 9 will work well (It did on my MacBook November 2006). However, X Plane 10 was largely a disaster. I recently bought a new iMac with 8 MB of ram and a very fast video card and X Plane works great. Fast, smooth and great graphics with Super Retina Display Hope this is helpful. Happy flying

 You have to have internet to download and install the game and updates. The game does not come with disk or packaging, but can only be redeemed through a Steam Application code.
 Of Course it can
 The code is to use the game on a steam account. I believe steam is free to downlaod. Got this for my son.
 Yes. This game is an online code so you need steam account and steam to play it.

 As far as I know it only works with the X box 360 controllers but I would at least try it in your case.
 Yes for both, but the cord may not be long enough to hook up to the tower on your PC, depending on where you place your tower.
 I don\t think so, sadly. I mean, you can map custom keys to the 1-12 buttons, but you can\t make macros with the mouse. If you wanted, you could, say, have the = key on your keyboard press 1, 2, and 3 on the keyboard (You\d have to configure the macro in-game, if GW2 doesn\t have macros, then you\ll need a keyboard with programmable keys or a 3rd party program or something), then in Razer Synapse, you could make button 1-12 act as the - key, I believe.
 I didnt installed the naga specific drivers, but the plugnplay one works fine, and simulates a number pressing on the side buttons.
 Well the mouse itself doesnt make any noise, of course it does while moving it. But compared to my other mouses before, Id say its quiet, yes.
 Logitech G600 is a similar model, but I didnt used it, so I dont nothing to say about it.
 Yes
 I would wait to see the reviews of it after its released then compare to Simcity.
 They made off-line play available after the initial release. Every version should be able to play off-line now.
 You need one to sign in to origin. There is an offline mode though. I am not sure that he will have fun with it. I havent played it in some time due to difficulty with new interface. Simcity 4 if you want fun.

 The game does have a great way of introducing you to the game mechanics. After a short time I felt like I had a good handle of the game.

 No, it doesnt fit the original DS. It does fit a DS lite though....hope that helps you out.

 Yes. The code is connected to steam so you should be able to.

 This game has Online Multiplayer 2-18. Do not see anything about Offline Multiplayer. Hope this helps you. Thank you for shopping our site, and have a wonderful day.
 It can be played up to 4 Players on the same ps3 & xbox.
 Only in the Xbox 360 dude
 Game is very violent and graphically shows people getting shot. Very little sexual content but this is plenty of cursing
 Yes, the Xbobe and play Xbox 360 ganes.
 Yes it will work with the Xbox wired controller. I highly recommend Titanfall. That is a great game.
 IN PC to can play with a PS3 Controller there is a program on google can fix and make u PS3 Controller useful on PC to play
 no just steam pretty sure uplay is just for ubisoft games

 Im not sure how many discs are inside - its DVDrom. It does include a Steam code and an Internet connection is required to activate and play the game.

 yes, this is English subbed game that will work on window 7

 I just play fifa with it. Dont think it vibrates.
 The controller can turn on by itself..you only plug in the reciever
 You need to purchase the charging packs separately.
 That it is charging my turns blue when they are done.
 The base itself plugs into the wall. In the controllers You can use any rechargeable battery with the normal battery pack holder that comes standard with the controller, or you can use the aftermarket tyco rechargeable battery packs which is what i use. Btw i have had this charger for over a year now and i love it. No technical problems at all. Lights red while charging then cool blue when done. Individual light for ea. controller. Very cool at nite. Hope this helped. Chance M.
 None. It plugs into a wall. But do not charge your controllers if you are using AA battery, battery packs.

 Yes, it works perfectly on a Mac. I tried it with OpenEmu which allows you to map the buttons. I only have the three button controller to test, though.
 Yes it will. It will also work with Atari controllers
 i have used mortal kombat on a genesis emulator, which is similar to street fighter. response time is fast and never laggy or unresponsive. however i used the official genesis controller, i dont know about a gamepad
 I tried mine with genuine Genesis controller and it worked fine
 Yes, I have the 1000 series and it fits like a glove.
 I dont believe so, but I could be wrong.
 Its almost all PvE - the PvP is optional.
 I think its just that retailers get more leeway on what to charge for boxes, whereas the digital download price is set by the manufacturer. Youll see the same thing all the time with books. The hard copy will come out for like $20 with a $15 digital download and then a few months later you can get the hard copy for $12 and the digital download is still $15. Amazon could cut the price of the book but not the digital version.
 yes
 Hi Nate, Yes ESO is most definitely worth trying. The community of players is very nice and friendly, so if you ever need help with something there will pretty much always be someone there to help you out. I think that once you play it for a few weeks youll pretty much be ready to make the long term subscribe decision on your own. You need to set up subscription in order to play initially, but you get the first 30 days free regardless and you can cancel your sub before you get charged. The game, for me at least, was immensely fun and engaging for the first 2 months. Once you play through the main story line and go through each factions area, the engagement feeling drops off a bit. But at that point the game becomes less story based and almost strictly pvp based. The crafting and trade systems are wonderful and fun. My advice to any new players is to look for a trading guild the second you hit level 10. it will make your life much easier. The random encounters are fun when they happen, but i didnt see them happening too often, hopefully they will make them more frequent. tl;dr definitely try it, lots of initial fun, late game fun is an acquired taste. Subscription worthy is only up to you.
 No it doesnt run through steam
 nope not even close and not recommended for any sort of shooter
 I would get a dongle and connect your ps3 or xbox 360 controller instead
 Analog sticks that are too tall. I never use it. Looks really cool, but the turbo isnt really turbo. Rather an auto-fire. Does not seem to increase speed. But I have not tried on all games.
 Yes, the turbo button toggles it.
 Yes but it isnt great and there is no indication when it is on. I wouldnt buy it for the rapid fire option.
 By tilt, you mean two additional click types by moving the mouse wheel to the left or right? No, The mousewheel doesnt have that functionality. Just center click, and the scroll.
 I bought one for a mac, and it seemed to work fine when I was just using regular applications (the DPI settings are changeable as they are built into the mouse) and I got all of the non-primary buttons to work using USBOverdrive (you can assign any button to do anything). Now if you are actually gonna use it for games on your mac, dont get it. Whenever I started a game (any game with the exception of Minecraft) with the mouse plugged in, my mac froze unless I was in bootcamp (windows 7). I had to send it back, and the Perixx customer support said they will be releasing drivers for OSX soon and to rebuy it when that happens.
 Net weight 5.00 oz. with weight it is 6.03 oz
 Yes, just behind the scroll wheel is a spring slider for you to turn up or down the DPI. I personally leave the DPI alone at about half of its max. You can also configure the buttons to have a sniper zoom function like for world of tanks I have the left thumb button set up for me to quickly toggle into and out of sniper mode. The buttons can also be changed to have a simple toggle set to change between 2 DPI settings if the DPI button is insufficient.
 My Alienware has a cd drive but the mouse comes with one of those little cds...I went to google and searched for Perixx MX-2000IIB software and found it and downloaded it and it works perfect.

 Yes it does. I have problems getting it to load. When I click on the regular icon it just wants to install the program over and over. I have to go into Finder and Applications to find the right icon to get the games started. (Maybe that is my ignorance?) Once I have it loaded, the games play with no problem.
 I dont have Maverick...works well with OSX

 The buttons will work as a controller, but you may have to reconfigure other games button assignments if they do not match Damage Inc.
 No, it has a wire. Its long about 8-15 feet though.
 Yes
 Theyre set to 1-0, -, and =. the g-shift key makes them act as ctrl+those same buttons. The mouses on board memory also allows these buttons to be changed via the software on one system, but the mouse itself will remember the changes so that you may plug and play on another system with your changed button layout.
 They are prgramable with the ability to do more then one button at a time so you could program Ctrl+c to copy as a button. Only problem I had was making the shift key function as a programble button such as Ctrl but you can program the shift functions and it works with shift key then.

 As far as I have been able to find out with light research, Logitech is probably trying to get more money for the same product just different color and call it a special. I doubt the cost is actually increased or any real reason beyond that. I personally wouldnt want a white mouse though, simply because black hides dirt and grime better. But a white mouse would probably prompt more frequent cleanings.
 yes
 Yes. I use it along with a G13 for AutoCAD at work. Having enter, esc, del, bksp, undo, redo, & other commands always available is a great addition. Honestly, I game at home, but I make better use of the G buttons with productivity software than I ever have in the games (not that I dont use them for those too). For repetitive, command intensive software, programmable keys are the way to go.
 If you have a G600 producted prior to Oct 2012 you will not be able to update the firmware on the mouse. You will be stuck with firmware 77.00.12. If you call Customer support, and have some time, they should be able to offer you a resolution. I battled with the spazzing and skipping of the mouse sicne I got i. I thought maybe it was my mouse pad, so I got a new mouse pad after cleanign the lens of the mouse. Still it continued. After i built a new rig, the sam e problem continuied to occur. I was able to finally find out that it was due to me being an early adopter for the mouse and that I would need to get a new produced mouse so I can perform updates.
 I thought it would at first but it never has
 No, they are well enough apart that they are easily pushed separately but it does take time to get used to it.
 claw grip is problematic because it becomes too easy to press a thumb key. they really need a raised fix ridge or ridges running between rows of keys so you can grip something with your thumb without also pressing a key Personally using this and the razer naga has caused a RSI with my thumb specifically because of having to lock it in a weird position to just to keep from pressing a thumb key
 That depends on your gaming system. You might have to ask Nintendo. I thought all gaming systems were the same not like DVD players.
 Just Dance 2015 was for our grandkids at Christmas. I did get a chance to do some of the video with the kids then. 2015 has a lot more of the newer songs and has a lot of new dance moves. With the three granddaughters it is important they keep up with all the latest moves. I am having a lot of fun learning with them. I am in a jazzercise class so these videos are a great help. Hope that helps you. Pinky
 The short answer is yes. We already had two controllers for both my boys. But if you really want to, uh, Just Dance... you can just stand behind the kids with remotes and dance along with them! My wife and I you got just as much benefit... And its just as fun. True, you just dont get to keep track of your score or how perfect you matched the moves.
 It require the Wii remote controller does not need a mat. Just a good set of space to move.
 A nintendo wii, it is a video game so you need a console
 open-ended
 Yes it does have Spanish language and is not that bad actually
 Hello, good morning. As I have understood the game is not compatible with the PS Move, if so it would indicate in the box the game; like playing Killzone 3 I hope its helpful. good day
 S
 From what Ive seen it doesnt have Spanish subtitles. Perhaps in a future update Spanish subtitles will be provided in the game. Your best bet is to enable Spanish from the PS3 crossbar menu.
//youtu.be/PEd5iQlwimc, this shows how to set it up.
 Just charging cant plug it in check your settings on you ps3
 I really dont think so since the headset and speakers are usually accesories that will pair with something else eg to a pc a console a car a phone etc, dont think these accesories will pair to one another then again i could be wrong safest bet would be using them both through a laptop.
 Its Bluetooth. So, yeah.
 yes
 Yes they do, and perfectly I must say! Just plug in the usb dongle into ps4 usb port and turn headphones on and your done, no setting it all up, microphone also picks up really good so people have no problem hearing you talking. There is also an app for ps4 called headset companion app and in that you can choose different sound modes and update the headset as needed. Even if these are more get these over the new PlayStation headphones the new ones are horrible, no bass! And with these elites you can actually plug anything with a headphone jack into the dongle and it will send the audio wirelessly to the headphones, I use them with my cell phone, tv, Xbox one and ps4 wirelessly. And you can also use them like a regular set of headphones with the cable if you need them but forgot to charge them.
 Pulse Elite&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gold.
 Most everything works on the PS4. The volume controls are a bit wonky but you\ll get used to them in time. The software side doesn\t work to lower chat volume and there is no your voice through speakers feature like Turtle Beach has. If you play a lot of multiplayer like I do, you\ll find a sweet spot and leave it there. As for being comfy? They are quiet comfortable. Of course if you wear glasses you\ll eventually get the geek headache from it squeezing them into your domepiece. Otherwise if you wear them without a hat or glasses on, they are comfortable. I\ve owned headsets from every brand on the market. Turtle Beach is alright but they break easily. Astro is by far too expensive and the company attitude/customer service is vomit worthy. Tritton is just... sad. Logitech and Corsair are awesome but console compatibility is an issue. This headset is actually well built and my favorite I\ve owned. It has some quirks but it makes up for it in ease of setup. Other headsets require a ton of unsightly cabling.
 If its honesty you want then theres only one choice The Pulse Elite i have two sets now my Daughter and myself best headset I owned todate, so good my Daughter had me get a set for her. Too many options to list what can be done with them but you will be very pleased. One set is over a year old the other close to a year now..Have not had ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL... And we both game alot WOW, Neverwinter,Diablo3 also Sniper and star craft all work great no flaws at all. So there it is now its up to you? and those are only a few games Ive tried with them good luck..
 open-ended
 No. The headset fits snugly on the head. Theyre not too tight though.
 With the open foam ear cups, you have very good ambient awareness. Sound quality is very good, although sensitivity is a little low if you try to use these for mobile device.
 The Sennheiser PC 310 Gaming Headset has a 3.5mm stereo (a.k.a. 1/8 or mini) plug and a same size microphone jack/plug...so if that is what size your ps4 requires then this will work. These size plugs are very commom form factor used in many electronics, smartphones, mp3 players, tablet/laptops, clock radios etc
 Mic works really well.
 This works very well, in Skype. The mic is good, and the noise-cancelling doesnt seem to cause any discernible lag, according to those Ive asked, since I got this. I dont seem to hear any of those pregnant pauses that seem to plague my cell phone.
 It is a USB headset with 3.5mm connectors for audio and mic.
 They are considered open ear headphones -- cloth ear cuffs.
 I think they feel like you would expect them to. it\s not hollow plastic, so it feels denser, but it is very plasticky. People around you cannot hear what you are listening to. They are open in the sense that they aren\t noise cancelling as much as one with leather or faux leather are, but they don\t allow the speakers to be heard much even if the headset is around your neck.
 Hardware wise they are the same. Looks and Audio presets are slightly different.
 Kim, Joshua has the best advice and have your son or you follow his instructions. If all fails contact Amazon and let them know the problem and you can get an replacement right away!
 I dont know what type of adapter you would need. The Xbox One has digital audio out (optical) that will plug directly into the base station of this headphone setup.
 Yes you will need a Bluetooth adapter for your PC.
 No

 I dont remember seeing anything about a warranty in the box, but I have used mine almost everyday since I bought it and not once have I had any issues with it. Turtle Beach makes really good products, I have three of there headsets and not one has had any issues. I would just register it through the website and if you have any problems contact them about it, I have heard really good things about there customer support.
 The wireless transmitter will pass through digital optical -- it has both an in and out port for optical -- so you should be able to daisy-chain, plugging the transmitter into the PS3, and the DAC into the transmitter.
 No. This is a gaming headset.. Its engineered only for games. The sound quality and its chat quality in playstation and Xbox is unbeatable but dont expect it to give you the same results via any other media source
 no sorry

 Depends on which game you are playing. No sexual nudity to my knowledge, there is a cut scene (RED6) of a character hatching from an egg and there is a full frontal of a woman. It is quite graffic...so if you are on the fence you might want hold off. Overall I loved the game, but I can understand/respect wanting to make sure.
 This edition has both physical discs and download codes. Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil 6 Language Pack and Resident Evil Degeneration are physical discs. Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Code Veronica X and Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition are download codes.
 No they were not remastered. You just receive a download code for the game on PSN
 Yes....
 Most of the time if the game was from another country it will state it. Wen i bought mine i just made sure it was from a state in the USA. I wanted the BIO-Hazzard Resident evil but it was only produced in Japan. Most sellers put what region...I looked at the game you are interested in and it looks like it would play in US only. Sorry i wasnt much help.
 Ive never played the Game Cube versions but Ive played the original PlayStation versions and thats exactly what it looks like.
 You need to give them your console , or tell them to add on an external hdd then transfer it to your console , and it has to be downloaded from your PSN account so you can play it

 I use the 3ds only for which this game was designed. My guess is it will not.
 No
 I checked my game and it doesn\t indicate being able to choose languages. I would suggest you contact Nintendo as their Help info is very good and they do respond rather quickly to customer questions.
 The game I bought didnt work in my console (2DS). I bought that one in Spain, I think it shouldnt be an American Console

 They are regular size. Not as big as Tree Rex
 No, it will not work with the ds but will work with the wii U. You have to buy the 3ds starter kit to get the right portal the good news they are completly different games and you get pop fiz with 3ds and of course you can use all the figures on both games.
 Yes
 This should work on the wii system with no problem. My grandson has the Skylanders & the Skylanders Giant.
 Yes you can use any of the Skylanders on the portal.

 No. PS4 cannot play PS3 discs. However, a limited number of PS3 titles are available on PS4 via the PlayStation Now service.
 The game reads like tablature, not musical notes and therefore is unfortunately guitar and bass specific.
 Yeah, it has both guitar and bass options.
 If this question has come to me because its the same one I purchased, rest easy, it will include the cable. Get ready to rock!
 No
) I cant speak to other wireless models however. But I would imagine they would work the same.
 if it has controller support it should. use joy2key if not.
 No it doesnt
 Its read as a generic input, so any emulator allowing button mapping (which should be all of them) should be compatible.. I used it specifically with dolphin, but should work elsewhere. I dont support emulation, and the only games I emulate are isos I rip off my own discs to play over the Internet Internet with friends.

//mayflash.com/Products/XBOXXBOX360/MF001.html you can see a diagram about what this adapter will enable you to do, as well as further details. If you are looking for a device to use a mouse and KB with an Xbox 360, you wont find one cheap. I have never seen one for under $40. Mayflash also makes one, called the Max Shooter for Xbox 360, and its the cheapest Ive seen.
 This is not meant for use with the PS4.
 U prob is conflict between nvidia chipset and you madcazt stick, but this adapter is fine to solve you problem, or any pci usb2-3 card..
 no I believe the original xbox controller had a round plug similar to gamecube. there may be an additional adapter to convert to usb but the product in question only has a usb port and a ps2 controller port
 Nop there is no way u can use with wiiu pro on a ps3
 According to Google the expiration date is never really set in stone. MW3 has regular updates so I would just enter it and you will most likely be good to go. I am sure the Playstation Network would make it right they are great at customer service.
 Negative, everything is in English and not even give you another choice. Whats more if you want to sell it is in perfect condition like new. I remain attentive to your comments.
 Holla
 From what I remember its only green.
 Yes they can! All four buttons on both sidesign can be individually reprogrammed to an extent. But in my case, many of the button are not fully reliable. I find myself not clicking as forcefully as I should, thus resulting in the key not registering the action. So no half assed cliclicking!
 i dont use a claw grip and i feel fine with it. I have the Bf4 version of this, so the top is sort of slippery, but the regular taipan has rubber over the center so it clings well to your hand.
 Hey mate, Im Razers super fan. I got every type of Razer mouse. Taipan is a good mouse, nice responds and comfortable weight. Just a little bigger than Orochi. But for performance, Taipan is better. I strongly recommend this mouse. If you want a smaller one, Orochi will be a good choice.
 Its a very flat mouse. Low profile and long.
 Sorry. Its is matching same tiles.
 I found out that I have Windows 7 and it work for me. So it should work for Windows 8.1
 Good day, I have not personally used but I understand that if it works, I recommend the brand to see what map is on PS3
 Yes, this is the English US version...
 Yes, Ive been playing with the G27 and had no problems.
 If you buy the game new, the voucher is still good until 2016. However, if you buy it used, the voucher may not be included or already used so it cant be used again.
 No, none of the God of war titles in this collection are multiplayer only God of war ascension.
 open-ended
 Maybe try again and check your spelling... All of mine worked
 No youll have to you psn for chains of Olympus and ghost of apart but be carful those two games are like dlc full games but some cases they have already been used so basically you might only get 3 games GOD 1,2,3
 I ordered the game on Aug. 28th 2014 even though I read a lot of comments mentioning that the dlc voucher is no longer valid (still thought two games for 20 bucks is a good deal even without all the extra stuff). So it was a nice surprise that I was still able to download all the dlc - the super voucher that came with it stated valid 06/15/2014 - 06/17/2017, so maybe now they\re shipping out updated vouchers or something.
 Plastic
 My copy came with everything. And the codes got me another copy of second game and trial of first... dont know if that is how its supposed to be
 Yes they are.
 No but it would be pretty cool
 Only partially. As shown in the picture, the programmable macro keys are backlit. Its also got a backlit volume wheel.
 Yes, It comes with software to change the macros.
 Good firm plastic
 Im not positive but I have mine running from under my desk and through the back of desk and I can sit it in my lap and recline in my big mens chair is say about six feet but I dont have a tape measure
 I do not see any compatibility options for MAC OS online. As a USB 2.0 connection, they are compatible to a certain extent, but are NOT 100% compatible with each other considering the WIN function that has programmable keys available with Windows software.
 2-5 players on 1 PC
 it works on Windows 8.0 but havent tried with 8.1. I assume it should work with 8.1 as well.

 The one I bought hasnt done that to me yet. It seems like a pretty quality product.
 No, the console version doesn\t contain any H scenes and a censored gore scene.
 Hello. It is Japanese only
 Yes you can. There is no problem to use this game on an American ps3.
 Yes it works perfectly and has not shown any signs of malfunction..
 I havent had that issue, i installed 6 games between new and old games to the HDD and its working fine. so far so good
 Im using it for BF4 with no problems. Not sure about Watch Dogs, but it works with all my titles, even GTA V (which requires a hard drive for content installation). Pretty sure youd have no problems, but if you did you can always use a USB stick alongside it or by itself.

 You need the 500gb slim version or you can take apart the regular 500gb one (if you have the right screwdriver). The 320gb and 500gb both work well, it just depends on how much space you need.
 You can turn off the WiFi connectivity if thats what you mean. Theres a button on the side.
 Believe me, it will make most of your dreams come true. Its that great.

 In my experience as far as power goes theyre the same. Ive played both from fully charged to no power at all. Neither one is better or worse than the other when comparing power!
 Im not sure I understand you correctly, so, Ill just say that I received my 3DS XL in April of this year(2014).
 Yes
 En el menu primo escoja Configuracion de la consola/ entonce Otras opciones/ #4, el primero opcion es Idioma/ escoja la tercera linea- Espanol. From the main menu select System Settings/ Other Settings/ #4- Language/ the third line is Spanish.

 Nope, it doesnt do anything for glare. It has no effect on the screen.
 No , Two filters one for the top screen and one for the bottom .
 Enough for 1 3DS XL.
 He means is the screen protector sandwiched between two disposable layers typically labeled A and B like on mobile phone screen protectors. Theyre simply for application and you peel them off in steps (sometimes labled as 1 and 2 instead). I dont know the answer, but wanted to help him.
 Its steam game. I am playing the game and enjoy it also. price is depend on platform and seller.
 What? Just hit escape and save the game? Then hit exit? I havent played in a while, so I cant quite remember, but this seems most logical to me.
 Its real product package and We will ship out. you need to activate the code through internet and steam account. There might be update for the game.
 It should do. Ive had my steam account since I lived in the UK and Ive since installed over 100 U.S games without issue, so you shouldnt have any problems.
 Nope. Its a game with 2 CDs to run on PC under steam and not a game code. I hope it helps and good luck with this awesome game!!!
 Not required, but it would make it better. We use the regular remote control and it works fine.
 No
 No, it does not. It is single player only. But my kid and I go back and forth until one of us gets 3 stars.
 No this not a multiplayer game
 No it is not.
 We dont have a Kinect sensor, and it works fine.
 I believe its just single player
 Im not sure where to find if it is or is not. I looked over case, instructions and disc. If you can help me with that, I would be glad to help you.
 Yes it works
 I think so
 Ntsc version only and not listed as region free compatible.
 No, it was cut during development. The game is single-player only although it does have multiplayer type modes besides the campaign but you play against the computer.
 they are good but .seem to go wrong easly got them replaced after breaking free of charge but now gone wrong again.
 No just Xbox 360
 In my opinion. No. Ive had to get the actual headset replaced four times, and bought multiple parts. This is a huge hassle and customer service was very bad.
 Yes it does. You have to install the piece that you talk into. When I did that, everyone in the game complained I was drowning out everything with a buzzing to THEM, I only heard a slight buzz. Dont buy it. Go for Turtlebeach, learn from my hardship.
 Yes , but you need to purchase controller adapter for chat.

 Yes that is the brand. Whats the question?
 CE (the first one) responds to it (although theres less buttons than on the XBox Controller) so I suppose its possible it would work for other games.
 Very authentic. Though I will say the first time you play it it can feel a bit stiff. But pay with it a little bit and it will start to loosen up
 it is a bit different. Its more like the Gamecube stick
 Well the plastic mold that you hold has the hole neccesary to allow that. But if you try to look through it you see there is no port, no way for actual electronic pieces to connect. I hope im making myself clear. Also when i connected mine, windows read it like generic vibrator joystick or something like that. But i havent seen mine do that. Not that it maters to me. Hope I was helpful.
 Ive tried heating it with he headset but it just doesnt work. Im currently ordering parts to to construct a very large microwave.
 Yes you may need an adapter to convert your your headphone/line out jack to the RCA connections for the headphones.
 Vikki, I am not sure how many gaming chairs will have a USB port to support amplified headsets. Unless you can tell me which gaming chair it is, I would get a headset like the PX22, Shadow, or Z60 that has a detachable inline amp. These would work as a passive headset using a 3.5mm jack or an amplified headset with USB -- you would have options. Another option that does not use an inline amp at all is the X12 -- 3.5mm plug for game audio and a 3.5mm plug for chat audio. If you have a link to the actual chair I can investigate it for you.
 My son has Xbox 360 3G. So I am not sure if it works with the 4th generation. I imagine it would though.
 Amanda this is strictly a wired headset, and while you can use it with a PC, it wont work with a mobile device. Let me know if you are looking for a wired or wireless device. And let me know if you want it to work with both an Xbox 360 AND a mobile device, or just a mobile device. I can give you both wired and Bluetooth options for both scenarios.

 Yes, it works with PC. The chat volume wheel controls the sound from the computer. All you have to do is plug in the headset, the drivers automatically install. Just make sure that the headset is set to be your default device in the sound settings.
 It can hook up to both. the USB is for the mic and hearing other peoples mics, and the audio/video is so you can hear the game through the headset.
 Not sure length but more than 10. I sit back and still have cord and its plugged in back of tv and front of the PS3
 Yes, thes bass feels great. You can also adjust the bass settings on your PC to your liking.you cant adjust the base from the headphones, so you will to do it through your PC. I hope this helps
 if you still have the original ps3 tv plug in wich is red white and yellow your supposed to connect those together. These cables are only to control the volume of the headset. So you should be good without them.
 It has in it Cleopatra 2, Coyote Moon, Triple Stars, Siberian Storm, Aztec Temple, Bombay, Three Kings, Lotus Flower, Glitter Kitty, Wild Wolf It includes other less popular machines. Hope this helps.
 Cleopatra2- Coyote moon- Double diamond- Double diamond 3x 4x 5x- Kitty glitter- Lotus flower- Secrets of stonehenge- Siberian storm- Three kings- Treasures of troy- Triple double 7s- Triple stars- Wild wolf- Aztec temple- Bombay
 I never had a problem
 this is a piece of crap , dont buy
 are u talking about chicken coop or are u talking about something else?
 It has been a while since I played this game so I really dont remember. I believe I just clicked in and out of the portals until I discovered how many crystals I had. Either way, the game keeps up with the amount of crystals and once you open all the games, I think that is when you save the forest.
 I didnt need the disc. However, on some of these games, it requires a disc.
 Off hand, No. I cant list the games, however, there are quite a few games and it is extremely enjoyable. You have to play to unlock future games. When you gain enough points or charms, it allows you to open a new game. You will like it.
 it sounds tiny because it is 150 ohms so it needs an amp to push it but the pc 360 are 50 ohm and dont need an amp ... jus look for a headset with 50 or less ohms and u wont need an amp
 Right click Sound (Speaker Icon) Click \Sounds\ in the context menu that pops up. In the Sound Dialog Box, look for \Recording\. Speak into your microphone, and observe whether or not green bars are displayed to the right of the active/default device (notated by a green check mark). If a device that is not notated by a green check mark lights up, right click that device and make it the default microphone. Problem Solved. If the device that is notated by a green check mark lights up, right click that device and select Properties. Proceed to \Levels\ tab at the top of the new Microphone properties dialog box. Locate \Microphone\ and adjust the slider beneath it to the maximum volume level. Add some \Microphone Boost\ as well. Go half way on the slider for experimental reasons. Click OK Right click the microphone again, except this time click \Configure speech recognition\ instead of properties. Run through wizard and test your microphone.
 Both headsets are somewhat similar. The Special Edition has its volume control built-in on the right ear cup, which in my opinion, is much better. Also, the PC 350 SE comes with a carrying case, while if Im not mistaken, the old 350 does not. Overall, the PC 350 SE is a totally improved PC 350, so the obvious choice would be to buy the SE, rather than buying the older model.
 no plastic but it is sturdy
 go with the pc350se IF you don\t want to hear anything but whats coming through the headphones. I think overall I like the PC350se\s better because of construction. I actually prefer to hear things in the room and the pc360\s are nice for that, plus I think I prefer their sound slightly better but I had to sell one so I sold the PC360\s. I use the Listen to this device soundblaster option so I can at least hear myself talk through the microphone on the pc350se\s
 Yes sir it is ^___^
 If you mean a plastic case then yes. I have one on mine and it still has room.
 If it adds lots of width then no. The 3DS XL is comfortably filling the case
 Holds 6, description is inaccurate.
 Its a soft interior hard shell case for the XL. Storage space for 3 games perfectly, might fit with a small case on the 3DSXL. Ive had mine over a year now and its held up perfectly.
 Yes! I use it all of the time when I take it to school and its great. I feel safe that it wont move around while in case or get face damage because the outer layer provides enough protection. Hope this helps!
 It does have offline Multi-player (split-screen) up to 4 players. Weve done 2 player split-screen mostly.
 Its regular version
 What region? Most are locked when you start the game.
 No. You can play the game with a controller. You do not need a racing wheel. As far as which racing wheel you should buy, I dont really know because I dont have one. But I would assume that any racing wheel would work as long as the game supports use of that peripheral. Its a fun game so either way, I think youll enjoy it. Have fun!
 Not this game but GTA.

 Yes yes yes..... In fact windows 8 is the best platform to run battlefield on you will get extra frames opposed to Windows 7.
 No
 if you want it on dvd it will be deviled but if you buy it via digital edition then amazon will email you youre ea origin code so that you can activate youre copy of the game. i hope my answer helps you out Benny
 Download the game from disc and go. Disc doesnt have to be in computer to use.
 Yes! There is even a chance to have baby triplets.
 yes
 Correct. You must have the Sims 3 base game to play any of the expansions
 Its on the back of the pamphlet that comes inside the case
 Yes
 It is my understanding that they offer only a single or three-user license. They are very helpful, go on-line and get their contact telephone number for sales they can give you the details
 the second computer does NOT need to be a laptop or portable, but the rest of the conditions apply. Let me know if you need more info.
( Good Luck. Ask again if you need more info. Michael
 Yes it includes a 1 yr subscription. I find this amazing because Quckbooks was going to charge me in Oct. $349.00 for my one year but I saved that by buying the QBs Pro 2013 upgrade and the one year P/R. I guss I will buy a payroll package from Amazon each year now.
 The answer is on your payroll key. It says unlimited or 0-3 employees
 The short answer is yes you can. You have to have a server set up (which you must have done) and be able to get through your firewall. Perhaps you have security set up already and will need to use tunneling software from a remote location.
 The Mac platform requires the Mac version of QBooks. It has the capability of converting the data back and forth between the Mac and PC versions if required. There are also a few functionality and feature differences between the Mac and PC versions, but they are pretty close.
 No, it is not possible for the 4 users to work at the same time. You definitely would need a multi user version.
//www.skylanders.com/video-games/skylanders-giants Look towards the bottom, there is a bit picture of the character Hot Head and it lists the systems there and also at the bottom of each particular game page. This means they only made and sold starter packs, which you have to have so you can have the portal for the figure to sit on and the game disc, for those systems.
 I bought it for WII 2 but I have been told it will work with either. It did work on the WII.
 Yes! There are 8 kinds of element giant skylander, you can use any one to explore a place or to break something where you find a giant icon. And you may some bonus or some stuff. Anyway you dont need to use giants still can finish the game (not completed), otherwise waste $$ on giants.
 PlayStation, Xbox
 Not, this character dont work wii u, you need special one

 You can pay 13 bucks a month for a limit of 1 character PER server(not data center. The data center is basically the mega server that hosts all the little servers/worlds). Save yourself a couple of bucks...as you dont really need multiple characters anyways...as you you can play ALL jobs with one character AND you can change your race once in the game.
 I bought and used it through the ff website since I had an account from the free trial. So the answer is steam free.
 As far as I know there is no problem with the disk you should be able to use it.
 Yes you will have to buy a second copy for a second account. You will need another serial number is the reason. There is a 14 day free trial that just came out she can use to try the game for free as well.
 Absolutely not! I havent had a more friendly environment than this game. Sure there are gold spammers here and there, but thats pretty much EVERY game. But as far as bots go? Who? Where?
 Yes. I bought it for my son and he uses it on the Wii.
 The package was not sealed but everything was included, code, etc.
 Its a universal figure
 Im sorry, im not even sure what they are. My grandson requested it for an Easter present.
 Yes. The figures are universal. They work with any system.
 Yes but not by design. Different consoles and tvs provide varying resolutions of the game graphics. The character will be the same on any console. However how clear the detail is and the colors will differ. Even on two consoles of the same kind. (Because tv is different)
 I only have a PS3 so I cannot say how it will work on a DS

 No, and strongly advise you not waste your money
 If its the one from haussbell, no. You have to buy the $60 from the Microsoft seller for it to work with original Xbox games. Anything but the specific Microsoft brand will not play original Xbox games.
 Its not OEM so model numbers wont help but I assure you it will work with your 360 s as it did with my 360 s to test for my nephews 360 e
 I am sure you can, just use the Xbox like a computer when it ask you where to save it you will have the option to either use either storage areas. Hope this was helpful.
 Yes
 All of The Sims 3 games, ie seasons, are expansion games of the original game. They add new features to the original game play. If you want to wait, Sims 4 is planned for release at the end of the year.
 I dont think it matters as long as you have the base game.
 Yes, you download the extra game content and they send an email with the game code you need. Its pretty easy.
//www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/ when you reach the site just type The Sims 3 and it will tell you if it can work. Because it really depends on the graphics and other hardware. Good luck
 It requires the Sims 3 base game. This is an expansion to the base game.
 Yes I bough some from orgin and amazon and they work fine !
 I would uninstall and reinstall and check for an update
 It is always green but you can change the brightness.
 Yes, you can use this with windows 8.
 Yes. The space bar, backspace, enter, any key that isnt the size of a letter key will sound different because they use a leveling bar. Still a MX blue underneath, but the leveling bar make a different sound
 this is my sons purchase but I asked and yes, you can dim it to all-the-way-turn-off the back light
 Yes it does ive had a problem with it but amazon fixed it right away everything is perfectly fine now.
 Taiwan and use it comes with both in an unopened box.
 Nop...
 In the words of Chief Keef, Nah
 It doesnt take batteries, it has a charger which plugs in to an outlet.
 Excellent sound quality for the money, two year warranty. Buy with confidence.
 I just stretched it across my room to measure it for you and i ran out of room lol. Its over 15 ft. Very long.
 The short answers is NO. Sennheiser makes no mention of Wii U compatibility in manuals or on there website, however, in a pastemagazine online review, they state, And they work well for the Wii U, too, even though there\s no mention of Nintendo\s weird little system on the U320\s packaging. We do not have a Wii U to try and verify this so take this information at your own risk.
 I think it may use both, Im still thinking if ill order one but I remember reading about this on the Sennheiser website. Id say give it a look. These are Xone compatible so thats why Im taking interest.

 I dont think so.
 It seems like you got the PC download version. There is a PC and a Mac download. Sadly, I dont think there are refunds on digital media.
 Yes it will

 I successfully played/completed the game on Windows 7, no problems.
 No, my strategy guide does not have blurry pictures.
 Yes, I have windows 8.1 and it runs fine, good luck.
 It runs fine from what I can tell
//mypdfmanuals.com/user-manual,GAMES%2BPC,SILENT%2BHUNTER%2B4,602056.pdf&cd=1&ved=0CCQQFjAA&usg=AFQjCNFV8O1WEi34883ajt3DDPsn9207vw
 Yes I have windows 8 and it runs excellent.
 Also, run the installer with administrative privileges. No problems
 The game can be played offline, but the game does have a multiplayer feature.
 Hi, Brian. I suggest downloading the Gold Edition that has the U Boat version included. I forgot what the version is called but I am very pleased with this game and you really cant beat the price. One thing this game requires a lot!!!! of patience to play it in real mode. I hope this helps.
 The core application is for the U.S. subs in the pacific against the Japanese. SH4 Gold includes all of the U-Boat missions that occurred in the Pacific. So it is like two games in one.
 I have not played this product on steam. I downloaded it from amazon directly to my computer. The product comes with a key that you have to use while installing the game.
 Yes, everything is easy to get to. All of the buttons, 3D slider, Sound, stylus, camera, speakers, is open. The picture and shipped product match. I have big man hands, and this fits.
 Sadly no, it more of stretches around the handheld than a snug look and the button perforation isnt set for the new 3ds xl. You can mod it but the whole thing slips off pretty easy being that it doesnt fit correctly.
 NO. This WILL NOT fit the New 3DS XL that released in Feb 2015. The NEW model has extra buttons, has the stylus and cartridge slot in different spots and is slightly bigger. I contacted the manufacturer and they responded saying there will be a new one for the NEW 3DS XL sometime around April 2015. No exact date though.
 Yes, it will close. There are two separate covers for the top and buttom of the 3ds xl. The game will open and close easily.

 Well the problem is very simple, this headset is made ONLY for the Wii U and 3DS. It wont work on a tablet. As for your 3DS XL....it works on my NORMAL 3DS...I dont like the XL so Im not sure if it would work on the XL or not, I think both the Normal and XL 3DS use the same head jack, so basically this would work on your 3DS XL, but it wont work on the tablet. It was specifically made for the Wii U and 3DS ONLY.
 No. Its permanently attached.
 Yes
 Well my son has the Wii u and uses it when he plays Black ops game to talk with the other players in game mode.

 I am guessing yes. Well constructed though, cause you still get the tactile feedback and it has a low profile.
 I measured mine... its five feet long.
 Works fine, im running windows 7 64 bit, already beat both episodes.
 I think strictly U.S.
 Yes that is what I play it on.
 It its compatible with Windows 7 but there is no guarantee it will run well. The problem isnt your version of Windows but how poorly it was changed to work on any computer.
 It also doesnt work for me.

 Im sorry I no longer own the keyboard. I sold it because it we terrible!
 It is a great looking keyboard, for sure, and might even have worked...that is, if I could have ever have gotten it to work with Windows 8.1 I was forced to return it because there were problems with the Windows 8.1 drivers...they may be fixed now, but I doubt it based on everything I could discover on the web about the keyboard. It was a few months ago, so you might give it a try but just wanted to let you know the problems I had with it.

 I am sorry. This was a gift for a friend of a friend overseas
 Well as far as I have investigated, theres a problem. Im trying to smooth out a connection issue with my galaxy SIII, and two of these controllers. I can get them to connect, assign them a control 1 and control 2, but they act as the same controller. I kinda lost interest in messing with it. Far as a ipad, im not sure what your outcome will be. However I think its possible, though difficult to get them to cooperate.
 Yes, as far as the mini box has Bluetooth. On both with games that support a gamecontroller
 Hi Lez, I dont have access to a Hisense TV, but this controller works very well with a tablet and an android tv box y have, so I suppose that if you tv is an android one with BLUETOOTH capabilities, it will do the work. Good luck.
 With the Fire TV box, it worked with directional arrows but it wouldnt let you select anything. It stopped syncing almost immediately. It looks great but I dont think it was made for this interface. Save your money.
 No it dont work with ios what a fules claim that it does

 Yes.
 yes, it does! I had an older version & when I installed the new one my old face was included. Saved a lot of time for me!!
 I use it with windows 7 so I cant answer your question.
 when the game system is on the bottom (in its position) there is a beautiful screen built into it ... thats why it cost so much .... and the sound is awesome ... I still love it, had it for almost a year now.
 I am not sure,..I think so,..but he is deployed..will ask him when avail..
 Yes it works you just need the conversion kit off the gaems website to make it able to carry it securely.
 Yes
 No
 Yes it comes with all the cables you need to connect the base audio.
 I have to wear glasses all the time too. I have no issues with these headsets with my glasses.
 Yes it is surround sound. And Id say the battery will last me a good 10-12 hrs of straight usage time.
 Yes, it comes with both the stand and the mix amp, theyre both in the box when you buy it

 Yes it is surround sound. And Id say the battery will last me a good 10-12 hrs of straight usage time.
 Yes, it comes with both the stand and the mix amp, theyre both in the box when you buy it

 No it does not but you should be able to buy the cartrhdges sepeeatly and play them on it
 Im not sure ,but there maybe a you tube video where someone test that issue I would suspect that any non licensed sega may possibly not work but, I own this its more than worth it I use it everyday its a must have with the games built in alone I dont even use the cartridge slot its a great product Im very happy with it
 As in you want to use this with direct current? You could use adapters for your application, remember to have some sort of breaker in line so you dont destroy anything
 Yes

 No there was no facebook back in 1990 when the Genesis came out

 if the game has a password system then it works fine, however i dont think you can do save states and other emulator stuff like that.

 Never used it and the button was firm enough that I never accidentally activated it.
 There is a software disk that comes with this mouse. In that software is where you can bind the thumb wheel to a key. The software only works with Apple and Microsoft op systems.
 I have no idea, i got the gloss black one which is about $95. You should totally go for it, its a great mouse and you will love it. BTW when i got my RAT5 a few years ago it was almost $70...
 it comes with 3 different palm pads, 3 pinky rests/pads, 6 weights, and the allen-key to change it all out.
//www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8vXprEuAqM Hope this helps I work on and build Custom PCs for a living with over 3.5 years Experience I have my CompTIA A+ Certification and My Crisco Networking Certification Tommy R.
 My advice is DO NOT buy it again.
 I dont know... but is a very good mouse! assembled with high quality components
 Yes
 Mine is about 4 and a half feet
 I cant confirm if it does
 Im not 100% sure but Id assume it can.
 The wheel is grooved and the mouse itself is heavy, so its easy to press the wheel without scrolling or moving the pointer. It gives very little resistance when rolling, just enough that you can feel the grooves; and the wheel wont spin on its own if you flick it.
 Based on your definition I would call it regular. The increments between scroll sections are distinct and well felt.
 It has a great ROF and trigger response but rpaid fire to me sounds like a hack. So no it cant shoot faster if you push the click just once

 Pam, No it is not...However Logitech might make a lefty....Jay
 Idk about the rechargeable batteries but it definitely fits the g-note 2. Thats the same phone I use with it.
 Works perfectly on an S5
 It takes ,2 AAA battery
 The unit is used in conjunction with your smart phone, in my case a Galaxy 3. The games are stored in the phone memory
 Nope. Not at all. There is no port for this thing, and it doesnt charge over USB either. I cant stress enough exactly how much of a horrible purchase this is. Also, your tablet doesnt have bluetooth? Is it an Android? If it is, it should have bluetooth as an option, but it might not if it isnt one. Still, in all, DO NOT BUY THIS THING. It is a waste of time and money.
 Well in not owning a Paspberry Pi I cant answer definitively. But seeing as how its pretty much a very small computer I would hazard to say that as long as youre able to get the drivers for the the USB receiver on whatever OS you use on the Paspberry Pi you should be good.
 Yes. 4 controllers and four headsets i believe.
 Yes
 Im unsure. Id go with a genuine adapter to T Try that. Just spend the extra X dollars and make life easier for yourself. The fake requires to use old drivers and install manual
 Because this is a generic model that doesnt accept the driver.
 yes it is, thats what I am running it on
 I have never had that problem. Maybe it was a fluke on that one program one time. I suggest if it continues you contact the tech dept. of the publisher. I have found most tech support departments have a great public relations record.
 Yes. I had to connect one to my laptop.
 I dont remember any activation key, I just downloaded it...

 As far as I know, its only in English, but it mostly uses pictures and numbers, so that doesnt matter.
 You do need the 3ds. Have fun!
 3DS games will only work on 3DS gaming system. You can play nintendo ds games on a 3DS gaming system but the way the game cartridge for the 3ds is shaped it wont fit into a ds gaming system. Sorry.
 I dont think theres a way to alter the appearance of the devilish head. What do you mean about stop the remarks about the scores? You can try reseting them if thats what youre asking, but they will keep poping out every time you finish a training.

 I believe its not system specific. As long as you have a portal and skylanders giants it should be fine. My son uses it on Wii.
 open-ended
 Yes-you need the Skylanders portal and game and system such as Wii, Playstation or Xbox. Make sure you know if Skylanders Giants or Trapteam or Swap Force is actual game he has, as figures only work on certain games. Hope this helps.
 Yes they do! As they come out with new game the old skylanders still work even with the new game. The new one just dont work with the old games. Example you cant use a swapforce with the giants game but you can use and skylander on the swapforce game. Hope that helps.
 Im really not sure ,sorry I cant help .
 Yes
 Simply only middle mouse.
 I used it on Mint, and got it working, but it didnt perform as well as it did on windows. It broke and they wouldnt honor the warranty so I cant test on my current distro. I would say go with something else for Linux.
 Hello! We only ship to the US, Canada, UK, France, and Germany.
 It can be programmed using the software, but in all honesty this mouse is not worth it. The tracking on it cuts out quite frequently. It just sits in a drawer now because it is too frustrating to use.
 Xbox 360 S Console, Model #1439 is what it says on the back of mine and it fits perfectly
 Yes, but the drive wont play older games
 Yes
 Yes, it slides in and works
 Yes it will. it fits in slims models and 4gb models. I bought mine about 3 months ago and am very happy with it.
 You actually dont, most games have plenty of compatible controllers. I would recommend buying the pro controller if you find yourself uncomfortable with the wiipad.
 Its less sensitive than the Dualshock. It lasts longer than the dualshock and surprisingly it feels a bit comfortable than the dualshock. Theyre both great controllers but I can see the Wii U pro lasting a lot longer in quality.
 You cannot. The wii u pro controller has no motion controls built in.

 I have not done responsive test with controller connected to system.
 No, only for WII U
 Can only be used with Wii u products, as far as i know. I know the microphone can only be used that way.
 Its actually a USB plug. XLR would be nice, though.
 I dont think so, this microphone was made for the wii u. I dont have a regular wii but u can check to see if the wii has a port u can plug in before u purchase.
 No its junk. Doesnt work period
 Yes it does! Rumble is here to stay. Although, over the ages and various controllers it differs from numbing like a pager to hard hitting. This is a middle ground. Gyro sensor is not in the controller - its not like a wii mote, or six axis knockoff. Its a pure controller with analogs, digitals, and rumble. 80 hours of battery life too!
 It doesnt. Theyre both just controllers.
 The game pad that comes with the system uses a propietary connection type USB cable. The pro controller uses a mini USB cable. You cant interchange the two. The pro controller connects wirelessly to the console, but uses the cable for charging; same as the game pad. The game pad and pro controller do not connect to each other.
 It cant be used as a PC controller conventionally (though of course there are people who have made it work through various outside means).
 it plays wii games also!
 It depends on where you buy from, a lot of different online stores in amazon charge different prices. If you are comparing 2 prices from amazon, one console might be on sale.
 All the peripheral devices from the wii work with the U, including the balance board. Original wii games also work on the U, including wii fit. However, the new wii fit U is a great upgrade from the original
 The Wii U and Wii are totally different systems, the names make that confusing. While Wii games will play in a Wii U, Wii U games will NOT play in a Wii. Sorry if that seems obvious, Ive had a lot of confused friends who thought the Wii U was just some kind of add on and not a new system. The Wii U is in true HD, with HDMI out. Its also not dependent on the motion controls any more, so a lot more games make use of the pro controller, a lot like the older pro controller for the Wii minus the need to plug it into the remote. That being said most games allow you to pick your control type, so if you loved tilt controls in Mario Kart Wii you can still use them, like the pro controller you can use that too. I owned a Wii and Ive had a Wii U for a little while now and I would say the quality of the games for the Wii U is much much higher. Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3 and Super Smash Bros Wii U are, for my money, the best yet in their respective lines. Also the new games are outstanding, such as Hyrule Warriors and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. The Wii U also introduces the ability to buy any game as a digital download, same day as the stores. Most big releases even get a midnight digital release! The Wii U interacts with the amiibos, that besides being awesome figures unlocks content in Nintendo games! The Wii U takes everything good about the Wii and makes it amazing!
 It is backwards compatible with ALL Wii mote controllers (original and with Wii motion Plus), along with all the accessories for the Wii Mote (like classic controller Pro). It does not natively support GameCube controllers but with the new adapter (shown in E3 2014) it will support both wired and wireless GameCube controllers.
 yep
//www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6553PW.
 It works perfectly fine with the NA console. Syncing the controller is very simple, its just pressing the sync button on the back of the game pad and the sync button on the Wii u console itself.
 Yes with both games
 Absolutely. It makes playing easier overall.
 You have to have friends with you. How evere you can have one frind and both of you can bring a Shakalaka with you ether Cha-Cah or Kayamba with you and they are CPU- Controlled.
 To be honest, no. Its difficult, but difficult in a way thats often very rewarding for a player when the time and effort is put in to learn monster attack patterns and optimal attack strategies per weapon. There are guides all over the internet and on YouTube to help a new player out with these things; I recommend ProJareds Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate videos for help starting out, and then a good search of whatever weapons a new player wants to pick up to see them in action. My first night playing I knew nothing and it took several hours for my group to down our first big monster, but then I watched, listened and practiced and the next night we played I was fantastic, knew where to go, how to hit and was prepared for everything that could be thrown at us. Its not easy to play, but it feels really, really good when you start to master it.

 Yes

 Yes, however if you played the originals on console, a controller would be much more comfortable.
 I dont see why it wouldnt. I installed it a while ago when I bought it for Steam. Windows 8 has the same folder structure as Windows 7 and Vista, but only a different Start menu. There should be no reason this doesnt work.

 It needs to be plugged in to the transmitter for it to work wirelessly This is not a Bluetooth device but it does work with the cord nicely. The receiver is USB 2.0 with a 3.5 mm male adapter if you want to plug your phone in to the wireless connection.
 Slightly over ear
 They work with our TV, sound system, PS4, XBOX, even the home computer. They work so well I got my brother his own for Christmas.
 Yes they do
 Most of the reviews seem to say it does NOT work with PS4.

 Yes it does work on Windows 8.1. It does not come with a CD. You have to download an N64 emulator of your choice and then plug in your controller. Once the controller is plugged in and windows recognizes the controller, you can go into your key configurations under the settings in the emulator and edit the keys yourself. Some emulators do require you to manually enter each key one at a time. The product works amazingly. Bought 4 myself and have it all running on my PC.
 Yes, though it really depends on what emulator you use. I use project 64 and it goes up to four. What emulator do you use?
 As long as you have a USB 2.0 and you should be fine. Just when you go into the key bindings hit the button on the controller, I found it was as simple as that.
 no
 Sure, all joysticks can be used as mouse device on Windows platform, this can be made with third-party software such as JoyToKey of Joystick-To-Mouse. Enjoy!
 Yes. The PS3 is region free, however if you plan on buying any downloads for those games, you would have to buy them from the Japanese Playstation Store.
 Yes plays Blu ray and DVD and burn DVDs
 Sorry friend, no backwards compstibility, Im afraid. Use the PS store/Amazon to get your fix. PS1 digital downloads are cheap and there are HD remasters of old PS2 games available for the PS3. Happy gaming!
 With analog TV is ok. Netflix, only suscribe credit card before to play app
 Very good item
 Yes It has the original firmware, But when you connect the console for the first time, begins to be updated
 Yes, it comes with one controller
 couple lbs
 No its two discs. Its in sleeves like if you got a used game at gamestop. It dont cases
 I have pretty big hands and when i palm the mouse my fingers dont go past the side. It gives a nice, full feel when holding it.
 I believe it has omron switches. Not sure on the scaling, just sounds normal. Much like my old logitech g500. Based on your last statement, its probably not the clicking. Try screaming at the game more it will cover the mouse and fans.
 Every once in a while the mouse will wander or drift. It\s correctable by unplugging it then re-plugging it in to the USB port. I\ve not noticed any problems specifically with the scroll wheel. I\ve also never mapped any of the other buttons, so I can\t say how well they work.
 I got this for my husband, he has a large hand and it fits him great. Not sure of the G9s size though
 There are two buttons right under the scroll wheel that were made with that in mind. They have + and - on them respectively, and are set to adjust DPI to whatever you like in the default setup. You can, however, change the function of the two to whatever else you can think of, so there is a lot of versatility.

 It should work.
 open-ended
 Included in the box is the mouse, base, and USB cable. To use the wireless function, plug the USB cable into your computer and into the back of the base. You then sync up the mouse to the base and your good to go. Be careful though. The base tends to be really picky about which USB port you plug it into.
 It uses a built in battery, cant remove it, the base this mouse comes with also charges it, but battery should never really be an issue, the mouse also has an input hole, you can play while you charge.
 Well I play usually 6 or 8 hours, then simply redock it in the charger. Ive not left it undocked to know how long it lasts. Im sorry!
 It should work, but not effectively. There are 4 or so buttons that you use your thumb to click, though I suppose you could use your pinky to use them. But thats only if you plan on using it to game fully- I use mine as a regular mouse without using many of the extra buttons ;) So it depends on your intended use.
 Yeah Vita is region free. I played it on my US Vita. Its just the DLC youll have to worry about. If you want that your Vita need to be using a japanese account to use the DLC.
 No.

 Its a wired mouse.
 No it does not. The wheel actually has firm clicking as you spin the wheel.
 In terms of plug and play yes, however I dont believe the software suite will be compatible with Mac.
 Yes it does
 Yeah its the arcade version
 Nope...I was disappointed to
 There should be a list of games in product info or on peoples reviews. As far as I know it does NOT have Galaga.
 No
 They are three separate game all around EZIO as the main character. All the games are on the disc but need to be downloaded as all the data could not fit on the disc. As long as you have space on your PS3 hard drive you will be fine.
 All come with the disc but the first two need to be fully installed (not from the Internet just from the disc) revalations is the only one that doesnt require a full install to play
 Yes
 I did not have to download any patches besides install ac2 and ac brotherhood, i would have to say no
 It has both languages in it
 I have no idea...The one sent to me is in German...
 Work fine on mine though you cant ult tab or minimize or you wont be able to open it back up.
 Yes sir it is.
 Yes sure.
 No its Windows only and requires the software from origin.com, runs in a boot camp partition though!

 Nope. Just up down. It is a nice wheel though, for me at least. Of course there is a mouse 3 if you click down on it.
 No, it does not have a free scroll wheel.
 When I first got the mouse, it was a problem and one that was really annoying, but after a while I changed the way I gripped this particular mouse . Keep in mind you can always set those buttons to do nothing via the included software if needed.
 116.4 x 64.4 x 42 mm
 I ended up buying the gaming surface made by the same company but I tried it on a standard mouse pad. Works fine either way. I just bought theirs b/c it gave me a lot more real estate to work with.
 It is compatible with windows 8 for sure.I am not sure about mac...
 Cable Length is 150cm (49 ft)
 You could use it for some light word processing stuff; Ive used it for a few short papers. Its relatively comfortable to type on but it really wasnt designed with that in mind, therefore the keys are very loud and have a slick plastic feel to them which can get annoying. If youre looking for a keyboard solely for word processing, Id look elsewhere.
{POIUYTREWQ!@#$%^&*()_+| | F1-F12 Up Down Left Right Apps Right/Left Windows Alt Ctrl Modifier Keys + Many keys as I can hold down and type still works as well Normal char keys many as I can hold down and the rest of the keyboard works as long as it\s the first keys are not modifiers. If you tell me what you need to work exactly I\ll try it for you and even download the game if it\s not giant like 20GB. I already I have a huge lib of mmorpg, fps, rhythm, and bullet hell. If your game is of that genre I most likely have it installed. As for the keyboard itself it\s a bit banged up today, but still going strong and I\ve hit over the 10 million press mark alone on the Q W A S D E keys and over 8 on Up Down Left Right. What can I say I\m a gaming junkie and I\ve wore the rubber off lol. -Andrew
 It is mac compatable. but i dont think the install cd will work seeing as it is an Exe, but i could be wrong
 Not mechanical. Gaming keys are rubberized ove I was happy with it. No complaints other then wasd keys are a pain to type with so I leave em off. Long coord for usb. Suggest watching a YouTube video before purchasing. Hope you found out what you wanted any other questions feel free to reply. In class atm but nothing to do so not a bother lol. Have a good day.
 probably off the sharkoon website or just get some third party keys. BTW, is this keyboard good? i just wanted to know because im starting to build my pc and i want a cheap, but good keyboard. Will this basically fit the standard needs of a regular keyboard and a keyboard to play some light games like minecraft, steam games, ect.? thanks i would love to know.
 yes
 Rubber dome/membrane, youll never find a mechanical keyboard that is under $55-60
 Yes
 The one l bought came in a Clear Case not that Greatest Hits.
 Si, it has subtitles both in English and Spanish
 Yes
 Unfortunately, it doesnt...just English as default language.
 yes it does, check your local gamestop though could they sld carry them now and cheaper.
 No it will not as it won\t fit properly on the new hardware. That c stick nub and the extra shoulder buttons takes the place of the Circle Pad Pro attachment and alleviate the need for it.
 Not that I know of. Usually games have an option for the circle pad pro in the control options (MGS 3 did), but Smash did not.
 I havent had any problems with scratching from either my circle pad pro or my one for the xl. Sometimes dust and stuff can get into the CPP if not used for a bit but dust it out and you should be fine.
 Frankly no. It adds nothing to it. The new 3ds has the two extra zl and zr buttons, and a c stick. If you want it for the ergonomic feel you can simply get a handle case.
 Both, The game has three modes for movement. Two use the mouse , one uses WSAD and the mouse to look around. Each is basically how you see things(Its all a third person view). You use the keyboard for quick actions or you can click through the HUD. Its a fun game. The Enhanced Edition comes with a lot of extras contained in its files.
 I bought this black unit as a replacement for my original wii as I had heard stories of wii ending production. My original console does play the game cube discs and has ports for the game cube controllers. This new unit does not. I havent tried the cube discs, but doubt they work without controller ports. Hope this helps.
 Yes, once you set up your Wi-Fi and get your Wii online, you can use Netflix or Amazon Instant Video directly from the options menu. Hope that helps.
 Yes it does
 Yes. Bowling, table tennis, etc.
 Yes there are games you can get that are the same as karaoke.
 No, its a psp 3000.
 No. System and game are Japanese. System can be set to English, game cannot.
 yes.
 Yes, I can still play english games on this handheld. Only thing i noticed that was different was the controls on the main menu are different ( like to enter the game). Awesome looking system though. Would recommend getting a clear case to protect the system.
 Sorry,this game is Japanese version.
 It connects via audio ports, not USB. You should have no problems.
 foam
 yes and they are very nice
 yes, but theres not a lot of games that are compatable with the mouse. Possible soon with the new diablo 3.
 Thanks for asking. We are sorry that we dont do international shipping.
 One of the best mice I have owned only problem I had was the nylon wrap on the cord came pinched as couldnt fix it and it can unfurled and had to cut it off but mouse functionality works super great
 Yes
 No a case doesnt fit well with this. I was able to cut my silicone case enough so that it fit.
 yes one charge. my only complaint is after almost a year I need to buy another the battery simply does not hold a charge any longer
 YES

 Thats made by Lighting Modz for the Xbox 360 sold through Amazon. Go back to the AMAZON page you purchased it on. on the right side of the page it will ask for a rating. below the rating area is a contact section to contact the company. when you do make sure your e-mail address is noted. Explain your problem and ask them to email the instruction sheet. when you get the sheet make copies as the paper gets worn. Its a good product for the Xbox 360. They have one for the Xbox one but its hard to get.
 No the mode 17 reprogramable is a bunch of different rapid fire options. just remember if youre playing call of duty they set a fire rate so if you set your mod too high it the gun will freeze.
 open-ended
 Yes it does
 I have not tried every feature of the controller, but the Rapid Fire does work with Titanfall.
 It uses the sync button to change mods, to go back you hold right trigger and press sync
 Dont buy it, controller broke in less then 2 months. Sticks stopped working to move around. Couldnt get my money back.
 This response is for the actual software shipped to you and NOT the download which *might* work differently. ~~ In previous years, I have used the software to file my own taxes and then passed it to a friend who also used it for her own taxes, including using the efile. (I never registered the product with H&R Block and she even has a different address than me.) I have not finished my taxes for this year yet, but if the previous years are any indication, then it *should* work again the same way. I find no indication that they have limited the e-files so that only ONE user can use them, i.e., nothing on the box or in the material says that.
 Has 5 free Federal, no free State files. Can print and mail as many as you like. Russ O.
 $19.95 for each state e-file. No filing fee if you print it out and mail it.
 Yes, Roth conversions are definitely supported at the form level. I started using Block 2012 as soon as the first download was available. A big reason was to estimate how much to convert this year. I dont recall that Roth conversion was in the original interview, but Ill check. Also, I bet that the forms are available in Turbo Tax too. Update, conversion is there in the interview too.
 According to the box, yes it will.
 Yea
 Yes, there is a cable that plugs into the headset, then plugs into the device that plugs into your pc/console. Or it can be plugged into a phone or mp3 player, etc. Its long but not too long, about the same length as most earbuds.
 Kinda, you need to buy the adaptor from Microsoft. Then buy a cable for the audio input, which is around $5. But youll experience issues such as adjusting the mic and volume. I personally wont recommend this for the xbox one. Just get the Skullcandy SLYR for xbox one..
 No they only work on the 360 xbox . I have both and use both..
 No.
 No not at all but still awesome
 Plug the av cables into the TVs audio out and then plug the USB cable into the Xbox .PS its not wireless spend a couple of dollars more and buy the Plyer 2 scucandy
 No
 The Skullcandy SLYR is compatible with the XBox One. It has adapters specifically for it, in fact.

 To be honest, Im not sure how the chat side works for the Wii U, but my assumption is that any headphone with a standard 3.5mm jack will plug in direct to the Wii U controller. You wont get surround sound or anything, but as a stereo headphone, it should work normally.
 Nope!

 To be honest, Im not sure how the chat side works for the Wii U, but my assumption is that any headphone with a standard 3.5mm jack will plug in direct to the Wii U controller. You wont get surround sound or anything, but as a stereo headphone, it should work normally.
 Nope!

 I have a 12 year old boy that loves this game. Hes been playing is for a few years, upgrading each time he can. Sometimes children dont want to take the time to read the instructions, but they have an amazing way of figuring it out on the fly. That said, there are instructions if a child should get stuck, so dont let them give up too easily. If your child loves trains, has an imagination, and any sort of engineering or problem-solving skills, this is a good learning and fun game/software to buy for them.

 I tried unsuccessfully to find the answer for you, even asking a few others. I googled Train Simulator 2013 - Amtrak Acela and found several youtube videos that talk about it. Maybe that will help you.
 I believe you can, but not with the basic software. This product is part of Steam, which is an umbrella for this and many other PC games. I think the cost to do what you want is high. Check out Steam on the web, and contact them.
 I believe it does. Syetem requirements are on the box. Also the website steam has Q
 nope its only green
 Not at all.
 the lighting on the keyboard is fully customisable, going from off to bright and everywhere in between.
 C = Caps Lock 1 = NumLock S = Scroll Lock I own the keyboard and love it! Perfect for me! xD
 Yup!

 The headphones themselves should work perfectly fine with the 3ds. Not too sure if youll be able to use the mic with them or not but the sound will come through them for sure
 It sounds like you will have to go through Razers warranty. I think they have a 1 year warranty. I would just go through Razers official website. Unless you get some heavy duty headphones, most will break if not taken care of properly. I hang mine on a hook when Im not using mine. Or, it could be a wiring issue when the headphones themselves arent messed up, but maybe the wires did get messed up. To prevent this issue, I keep my wires twisty-tied together so they dont touch the floor. Ive gone through extensive research on how to protect headphones because Ive had a few that Ive gone through and finally found that if you take good care in protecting them & making sure theyre taken care of, you can prevent these damaging issues. But yes, try to redeem their warranty through their official Razer website.
 No. It comes with a Aux to Audio/ Mic cable. So you can plug it into a laptop ( Build in AUX cable) and use it or plug it into your desktop ( Splitter, AUX to Audio/mic cable).
 Yes you can

 Yes I believe so. I purchased all of the Skylanders Giants only for my son to play on the Wii. Hopes this helps.

 Not sure, if dont have animals. Have you had animals and sold them? If you continue to have the problem, re-install and try again.l
 Im sorry, but cant answer your question. I cant even play mine. It says I have to make an account and when I do, it offers me other games to buy. I just want to play the game I already bought and cant!! I contacted them but got no help. I hope you have better luck getting the answer you need!!!
 Ok, if you have downloaded them, you have to copy the file (right click, copy) then go go your documents-my games-fs2013-mods, then paste the file in there and it should work
 with a mod
 Yes it will i have windows 8 and it work fine
 You are able to play but you both have to have the game. Then you could use email battles or real time versus online.
 I cant say; I have Windows 7.
 The dont have Linux support and Steam key

 I Would say a little clicky its not annoying loud like when you hear it in an office
 Yes, but considering how much of a pain it was to install the drivers to make the monitor for this device work on my own computer, your better off spending the same amount of money on a better keyboard. It does look great though.
 I use it with Windows 7 with excellent response. I do not know about Win. 8.
 It worked with my Dsi Xl.
 Hey, its should. I never got mine but the game slot is the same size in the 3Ds and XL.

 Yes it works on DS DSi & DS Lite all 3 connect to the internet the same way to use this product but you have to get a hold of the manufacture for the computer App to download

 Its relatively quiet. Its not a mechanical keyboard so its not that loud. Its average Id say.
 no
 Yes it does. It doesnt tilt up a lot but its better than flat.
 The one I received has three colors, blue red, and purple. Changeable by pressing the fn key and the number pad 5.
 i think for 1 yr but not sure we have had ours for a couple of yrs and it is just fine.

 Yes, this plays all Wii games. It has the console, antenna, controller and nunchuck. This one also includes the skylanders start up figures and the game. The blue color is specific for this skylander bundle.

//www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/ offers a pretty decent guide to what different types of mechanical switches are and do. The key lighting is still white, and the keyboard itself is still black.
 There are several levels of brightness. The function keys at the top let you cycle through the different levels.
 It should work as a basic keyboard but I dont think the media keys/shortcuts will work
 A reprinted Tab key would be the correct width, but as it\s much higher up on the keyboard (R3) it won\t have the same profile as the other (R1) keys to which it\s adjacent. The real problem is the 6.5 spacebar, which is practically unheard of. Only one other keyboard has done it (the Corsair K70), so swapping in a custom version may ultimately prove impossible. Of course, this is all only relevant if you plan on customizing the bottom row--there\s nothing inherently wrong with the layout, it simply has non-standard keycap sizes.
 Yes. You can toggle the light settings by using the function key on your keyboard with f4.
 I honestly dont know. Whey I tried getting online it kept saying I needed to pay something and that I couldnt redeem the code, they may have disabled the online server but idk.
 The level of play depends on the level you set it and the amount of control you wish take over your player also as you progress through a carrier the game becomes more challenging as you move up
 Yeah you can play online against/with other players.
 you need, press the select button and then you can go into inbox, anything you can ask me again. ; )
 Yes. Though I wish there was more detailed scouting reports of pitchers from other organzations in RTTS.

 My son uses his wireless controller on the XBox 360; dont know about other wireless devices.
 The Xbox 360 fits but its tight.
 Yes. my son traveled with his system in this case regularly.
 1. The Wii-U Tablet. 2. Original Launch Wii Remote 3. Wii Remote with built in Motion+ 4. 3rd party Wii remote with built in Motion+ As long as the battery compartment is in the standard location on the back it works fine. You just put in the energizer battery, and it lines up and charges. If you for example had a Motion+ add-on on the controller, you would have to remove it to allow the remote to sit properly in the charging dock though.
 This comes with its own charger cord, so if your original cord is damaged you can use this to replace it. However, it wont plug into the Gamepad directly, itll only plug in to the cradle. So you still wont be able to play games on the Gamepad while its plugged in unless you get a replacement from Nintendo.
 No
 Indubitably
 Ya it will sit and charge just fine.. i was the same way thinking it wouldnt and gave it a shot and worked out good and this charges the pad super fast i love it
 Yes it does
 Yes it will.
 Not really. Its the Chinese version but the Chinese version is completely in English. So basically this is just the disc version of whats on the Playstation store.
 Yellow best, amigo.
 I think so. thank you for your question

 Yes I am I havent been able to fix the problem either
 No, the USB port is just to program the controller using a PC.
 It does not click, but the wheel has enough resistance that it doesnt move around too wildly.
 Oh yeah. I use it every day at work because I use a lot of shortcut keys and since there are 9 on the mouse that you can make whatever you want, it works great!
 6 feet long.
 For some reason I got an email of this question, I bought the 4000 dpi version and you cant set it like you asked. I did read the 4000 has less options in the software that comes with it compared to the more expensive higher dpi versions. Probably doesnt help but the best I can do.
 From my palm to my index finger is about 6 1/2 inches. I can rest my hand on the mouse with the heel of my palm on the table and my index and middle finger rest comfortably on the 2 mouse buttons. This still allows my thumb to manipulate he three buttons at the thumb rest too.
 Yes this works with the Shield Tablet. Ive used this and 90% of the time it worked flawlessly, occasionally, when connecting a bluetooth keyboard such as the Logitech K810 they would interfere with each other and cause stuttering. Disconnecting and reconnecting the keyboard would usually solve this issue. You can play games and operate the tablet with this though.
 No, you cannot tilt the mouse wheel. There are two buttons on each side of the mouse, as well as mouse wheel click and scroll, and the normal left/right clicks. All are customizable in Synapse.
 Increased DPI, color changed to green, battery life doubled with the use of the newer bluetooth standard.
 yes, it is 2013 version
 Well Im not sure, I use mine with a MacBook Pro so I have built in Bluetooth. But I would imagine you would open the Bluetooth settings or where ever you can see what is paired and hold down the four edge buttons and wait for it to show up.
 No
 No my friend it wont fit because is not design for Xbox one!
 I do not have docking station, but could not attach my keypad with it on. Also, within a week the grips on both controllers had started peeling off and would not stick down again.
 Ive had mine since April of 2013 and it as only just now started to peel the outer textured cover off. The padding is still intact. If I can get the padding off, I ll buy another set for it.
 I dont believe you can get a digtal one, but if you need one give me your email and I can type one out for you an send I your email.
 Aim bot is for Zombies only.
 Yes . I used x12 on mine. And it was excellent. Dont run tactical setup if you want to drop sho . It wont wor . Run default.
 Yes send me number and Ill send u a screen shot of it

 No it did not. It only had one controller and the console box. No games or cords were in the box. I thought they might come in another shipment, but they never did.
 This isnt the original Sony PS3 system that was released in 2006. It is second re-designed PS3 model, but it does come with wifi, Netflix capability, and other functions the first re-designed model have.
 Slimmer, Lighter and a Slide To the side of the Slot where the CD Goes.
 256 mb system and 256 mb video. Its plenty for the simple task of running one game. I havent experienced problems with streaming, videos, games or anything else. I hope this answers your query.
 The newer console
 I think so you will need a different control for the game cube
 yes, we use it on our hdmi tv

 There is no additional game included in this newest version. This WII is not gamecube compatible.
 Not in the standard game. It does cover pretty much all of the Isle of Britain. Wish it did include Ireland and I really dont know why they left that out since you have the option of taking the chunnel or a ferry ride to the UK to deliver loads from mainland Europe. I know there is one expansion but I think that adds in some cities/countries in eastern Europe. Shame really that Ireland is not in the game. Course, it is possible that game mods may exist that add it.
 open-ended
 Absolutely, I run it just fine on Win 7.
 Yes
 Yes, I use an Xbox One controller and am almost certain that you can use an Xbox 360 controller as well.

 The wii mini has no internet connection, its just for playing games. It uses the original Wii games, not the new Wii U games.
 Yes, regular Wii games will work on this nice console. But Wii U games wont work.
 There isnt one, at least mine didnt come with one either. Sadly, those days of the good ol 30 page NES manuals are long gone.
 There is a main hub that people you meet along your journey will also travel to and you can fast travel there from any bonfire you have lit to trade or level up.
 You can decide to have it region lock or worldwide in the in-game settings.
 Yes. You pick gender, hair, features and build.
 Yes. It will require an Xbox live gold subscription.
 Yes, absolutely. Play it on the easiest difficulty your first time through as you learn the mechanics (normal, classic) and dont be afraid to look up any questions online. I had never played an FE game before and I loved it.
 Theres a couple things that I feel really help it stand out. For starters theres the relationship system thats in place - which not only gives better bonuses when people with higher relationships are next to one another, but it also unlocks conversations between party members that can be insightful, and entertaining. (I love character development, personally). Relationships that reach an S status can also result in 2nd and 3rd generations entering into the game. Dont fret! this is handled well, and plays in line with some of the other options of the game. Its not as forced as it may sound on the surface. Secondly are the reeking boxes and maps you can download. The boxes are ingame items purchased with ingame currency and let you create random battles to help level up your army and build relationships. These things are invaluable. The maps you can purchase are a lot of fun, and often give you boosts in income or experience, but they dont impact the game itself - youre not missing out on important game stuff if you skip buying these. Lastly, the option of playing casual or old school is nice. Casual removes the finality of death, and its a great option when you just feel like relaxing and enjoying the story. Old School is great because its nice to be able to play the game as intended. You can play either of these options on easy or hard settings on top of it all. Theres a little more to it than that, but those are the things that I feel stand apart from previous versions. Ive gotten pretty deep into the game, and I really cant find anything to complain about so far. Im enjoying building relationships, and the story is interesting, and the game play smooth. If youve enjoyed past Fire Emblems, chances are high youll enjoy this one.
 Correct U.S game requires a U.S game boy
 I would not recommend it. It is quite violent and can be sexually suggestive at times. You could look into another series i play which is Rune Factory.
 No. It is region locked to NA Nintendo is well know for this.
 It registers as a pro controller,and yes it is wireless.
 The right thumbstick is offset like the Xbox Controller, which makes it a more comfortable controller IMO. Its also cheaper. However, Ive had 3 of these and the left thumbstick lost tension on all of them after 3 months of moderate use. You can find the Japanese import of the official Wii U controller for $39 on here. I would suggest buying the more reliable controller.
 For me is very long lasting work more time versus wii u remote
 Its supposed to be awesome for Smash. That is the reason my son asked for this controller. 1st Item I purchase did not keep a charge. So I had to send it back. I reordered a new one.
 A red light appears when its charging.when its done it goes away.Your controller should be able to work wireless if it doesnt then its defective.
 Yes, youll have to create an account, or use a previous one. If you dint have stream downloaded, during installation of shogun 2 out will ask you to download it for you. Hope this helps.
 I have windows 8 and it runs perfectly for me.
 You can play offline to with ou no problem, online online if you want to play multiplayer
 I look into the resources of the disc and just bring manuals in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian. Sorry but I dont see any chinesse, but you know what maybe when you installed trough steam they give you another lenguage option because that game is WOW
 it works on windows 8 tried it myself
 Just cut and paste. It has no capabilities to do surround sound. All it has is a analog left and right RCA input jacks. Go to Skullcandys website and check the spec.s out yourself.
 Yes, if you use the Auxiliary cable port on the wireless base.
 Yeah mate they are called, my little brother and I play call of duty online, they are light and good quality sound for the price, its worth the money, I use them on PC
 In fact, no. They require a transmitter to your computer or pod with USB power from a wall socket to it. The headphones are great at home only, or with power and a laptop on a Wifi hotspot.

 I dont think so.
 As far as I know, only a few specific games on xbox are region free. If you bought your xbox in uk, this might not work. Ps3 is region free, which Mr Delahunty may be thinking of. Good luck.
 no, they pulled the plug on everything.
 Go to ur settings it should let u cuz I have full control is it not letting u run to catch the ball ? Are throw?

 Yes it works i am playing it on windows 8
 Yes it is a Steam key that you are given.
 Well that\s the way I did it. On the main steam window, at the bottom left corner, there should be some text that says add a game. Click on that, and then click on activate a product on Steam. You should redeem your code there.
 No, you do not need Internet unless youre playing multiplayer.

 Yes the mouse does freeze I bought two of them and both of them freeze. I online game and it is a huge problem. I must return both of the products.
 No I doesnt. And that is how it is with alot of people who bought this mouse, including me. It freezes because its cheap. Its a horrible mouse, if anything try and return it.
 Yes they can. Currently only the amount of buttons can be keybound, without adding shift or cntl. But the amount is almost endless. I have all button bound, and again with holdin shift, and again for holdin cntl just for wow. Its very customizable.

 No. 2.0 characters are incompatible with 1.0 game.
 I have not tested it, but I see no reason why you shouldnt.
 Yes
 This is the original starter and can only play with the 1.0 version characters. All the marvel character must be played on the 2.0 version software. Sorry, no marvel characters for this starter.

 The characters and power up disk work for all different hardware. So if you have a Wii U and get an XBOX and buy the play disk, the characters you have will work for the xbox.
 They do not work on the original Wii. My understanding it that it works on all the others Xbox 360. Play Station and W U.
 The 2.0 will not work with this pack, the 1.0.
 I dont know. You need to make sure it is compatible with wii. If it is wii u it wont work I dont think.
 If your starter pack is one of the 2.0 versions. if not, then only those characters that are NOT 2.0 will work.

 The one we bought here on Amazon works great. This looks like the same one...no problems so far.
 No, only on LG brand
 sorry it doesnt
 by doing a search on the AC unit you will get the serial number of the remote. I would not trust any one person to know which remote works with which AC unit. Then when you get that serial number you can then go to a replacement guide that would recommend which remote to purchase. Do your own research and be successful Cheers!
 Yes, it will work with an X41.
 Yes
 The M5 model is designed for mobile devices and is not compatible with the Xbox 360 console.
 it should but I am not 100% sure

 Yes absolutely
 It goes right in
 Yes, it can be used on the xbox 360 slim console in black.
 It Works perfect. Thanks! but. I got the HDD about a month.
 Yes
 It actually doesnt turn it on but all the other functions work for it
 Just plug it in and its fine
 I dont know, I dont have a mac.
 Ive played it with ghost, it worked just fine. Im not sure about the turbo I think it worked but Im not positive I prefer to do it my self anyway. Ghost has the option to change the triggers so it is similar to other Xbox but they had to be pulled down pretty far to register the shot so I didnt like it much. But it does work
 Hi, yes it comes with a fairly good semi hard type carry case, which holds everything you need together securely and offers good travel/ storage protection for everything inside.
 Unfortunately it wont as the Sabertooth has no wireless capabilities.
 yes. the rockers and the additional shoulder buttons can be programmed to serves as any other button on the controller. you cant program new functions but you can program the rockers with the axby buttons so your thumb never has to leave the stick, for example.
 gaming head sets for xbox have a line for stereo out and a line to the controller for chat. The line for chat that goes to the controller is a 2.5 jack, the headset is a 3.5 jack. better off to contact Razer support to see if a splitter will work before you buy. A proper gaming headset is better if you will be using it for long periods and wont damage your hearing as much in the future. Sorry I couldnt be of more help.
 Yes
 I\ve never used the Nostromo, but I can tell you that the D-Pad is very sensitive in my opinion. It has a good solid click to it, and each of the 8 positions can be mapped to whichever keys you like. The only problem I\ve had is that the 4 diagonal positions are very hard to achieve without first actuating one of the polar positions. In other words, say you wanted position 2 which would be between W and D in your case. I\ve found it\s nigh impossible to actuate position 2 without actuating either W or D first on accident. But if you are primarily using it for the polar values, it works pretty well.
 I own both devices, one is not even remotely like the other. The Orbweaver is wonderful for gaming, but the 3D mouse is an incredible design that allows you to almost feel like you are handling the model you are working on. If you have never used a 3D mouse and do CAD or animation design in 3D, you need to buy the 3D mouse, it is awesome.
 This has an extra row so with smaller hands Id imagine it would be harder to reach the extra row. It would probably be slightly better to hold in the WASD position due to the adjustable palm rest and the slider all the way closed if she doesnt care to use the extra row.
 I have somewhat smaller hands and I can barely reach the third row. So I am currently just using the bottom 2.
 This is strictly for gaming, not a replacement for a keyboard
 I beleive you can if you have RGB and OYR on the monitor so you can stack up dem subs!

 No it does not. Jenny
 Honestly I dont know. it didnt work for me when I got it. It was defective so i sent it back
 Does it madder?
 yes it do come with a code.
 Yes, you have to already own the Sims 3 core game. This particular game is a expiation pack.
 yes university life is a expansion
 Yes you will need the base game.
 I dont believe so. Im not 100% sure but I think I tried this with my sisters Mac and discovered that it didnt work.

 no you dont have wait your registration code should be on back of the manul you do have to register your code online with square cinx though in order to play the game
 If you bought the game used, then yes you would need a new registration code and if you bought the game new, then id file a claim with amazon that the seller misrepresented the item you bought.
 Yes, you can use any FFXI related gamedisc to launch the game on 360. As long as you register the codes you buy online to your square-enix account youll be fine. It will download/update any content youre missing automatically.
 Mines still running after a few months so Id say its good enough for that
 As far as I can tell, you can only program them for programs that let you change button configs. You have to go into the button config of the program and set each of the buttons to what you want.
 Didnt recieve any software with the mouse and could not locate any. Now, having said that, its fairly easy to set the function for each of the buttons. Simply press the key on the keyboard you want a button to use while holding down the button on the mouse.....wait a minute...I think its the other way round...hold down the keyboard then select the mouse button...hmmm.....cant remember now for sure...&lt;laugh&gt; Doesnt matter, just try either way and whichever one will work.
 Yes, the side buttons also function as back and forward buttons on the internet.
 If your asking if its like the sound of a mechanical one no. Other than that it has the normal click noise... (Also depends on how hard you hit it)
 I dont know what you mean by that... whats a yy or xyy?
 I personally dont play halo but every other first person shooter game I have played it has worked so it should
 Yes
)
 I had the same question when I bought it but sadly it only works for games like call of duty
 Press LT & sync at the same time to turn the mod on and again to turn it off. While on press sync to cycle through all 17 mods. Excellent controller if your looking for a good bang for your buck.
 Yes
 Just return it it may be broken true delivery
 Its came with a paper but they work even though I dont use it
 Yaaa you can I use a rechargeable batter pack too and it works fine
 Not for me. Brand new
 Yes
 Yes, the XP510 provides surround sound for Xbox 360, PS4 and PS3 consoles. You can also use it with an Xbox One if you add a chat adapter and a talkback cable.
 Yes, it has a one year limited manufacturer\s warranty, which is typical for electronics. However, because of the cost of the headset I would buy the extended warranty, if available. I purchased my headset at Best Buy and paid an additional 89 bucks (?) I think for 2 more years of warranty over the standard warranty.
 If Im not mistaken, it works with all of them but needs a special connection for the Xbox One.

 You must use a chat cable between headset and controller.
 Although I do not know of a delay, I can tell you the bluetooth on these headphones are trash.
 Yes. The headsets bluetooth port can only channel one bluetooth source at a time, but I frequently connect my laptop via bluetooth and listen to music through that connection, while also listening to a feed I create from the wifi base, which I connect to my PS4 via digital audio.
 Actually, if you use a cord for PS4 chat you should purchase the PS4 Talkback cable, it has mic mute and mic volume control on the cord itself. The mute and chat volume buttons on the headset only work with wireless bluetooth to the PS3.
 Its not that small, but as with another headsets you can adjust the headband so it rest nicely on you head and hears, and if you think that its going to feel loosely, the headset really trt to push the earpads to your head just enough, so you dont need to worry about going to fall from your head. And its very confortable for long periods of play.

 The hint button will give you info about it or you can also google the walk thru for the game and go to that section of instruction.
 Yes, the Corsair M95 will work perfectly on most surfaces. After you download software for the M95 off the Corsair website, you can run a test and the M95 will detect the quality of the mouse mat. That will make the mouse be able to be more accurate on the mouse mat you are using.

 No, it has the buttons on the left, and theres a spot to grip it on the right but no pinky rest
 Its available for purchase now.

 Yes, both text and voice dialogue are in English.
 Yes. It has
 Yup! Battles only of course and not until you have enough party members.
 Yes it is but when you link to a character only one person can use the pair
 Yes, no problem
 Yes
 well its easy you only just put it on your computer and Install the game probably it will update something if you have internet connection at the installation process but its easy to install. XD good luck
 its like any shooter at 3rd person, its a very cool game.
 if you mean does the game have software updates and patches managed by steam, then yes. or if you are asking about different language options (spoken and text), then that is managed from the steam launcher.
 No steam.

 Back in July Ive tried most every platform that you could imagine... most probably itll never work. You should return it to your vendor if you can.
 No its not compatable with the OUYA console. On a side note Forbes magazine dubbed the OUYA basically dead you should pack it up and wait for it to be worth something for collectors lol
 It has blue tooth compatibility. I ordered it and had to return because I had original kindle fire. Made the mistake. New hdx should be good to go. I was aiming to use with all my old Roms from n64, the controller is identical to Xbox and just as good quality. Cant guarantee longevity tho. Like I said I returned mine.
 Yes, the firmware is updated
 You can find it in your Amazon purchases. Go to Your Orders and then, under the product, it should give you the product code.
 2 players. But bigger monitor but better view.
 Yes. Steam required.

 Yes. Its a link to the Steam system which actually holds the game. There is no way to play the game without internet.
 No because it do not work.

 I would recommend having at least 1 gigabyte or less for game saves, if you want to install it you need at least 10 gigabytes of storage.

 My 7 and 8 year olds do great with it. My 5 year old struggled. He mostly just runs around and hits things. The Lego games are great because they are much like puzzles. You have to try and figure out the sequence of actions are before you can move forward. This proves a little challenging for my 5 year old and I would think most 4-5 year olds would enjoy it for the fact that they can be Iron Man or other character but they won\t progress much in the game on their own and may get bored after a few minutes and want help. Hope that helps.
 If it says Wii U, it will NOT work in Wii
 no... you would have to get the wii version -- anything with wii u does not work in the wii

 its been so long I forget. and don;t have the item installed anymore. sorry I couldnt be of more help.
 What part of the instructions are you having trouble with?
 No. It isnt.
 There is a button on the top right that cycles through high, low, and off and the keyboard stays lit on high and low as long as the computer is sending power to it.
 If youre using the logitech software that maps all the keys for you then yes, you can map the key to open a website, toggle another program, etc
 Yes. Macros are modified via the software (or use of the M1-3 and MR keys) and saved to the internal memory.
 FN + F6 to mute FN + F7 lower FN + F8 higher
 The default setting of it will change the sensor DPI based on settings in the control panel for the mouse. They can range from 250-2500 and you can have 3 preset ranges to cycle through. In addition if you dont want/need the settings changed it can be reassigned for other functions also in the control panel along with being disabled if not needed at all.
 It should work without problems, at least as a generic mouse.
 About 6 feet
 Yes. It will work on Mac. However some users have reported some issues with Macs, though it should at least be usable.
 It does not work on glass
 The G400s is larger, but it is very well designed to the form of a hand. It may be more comfortable for your grandson...
//www.logitech.com and click on the contact us link. just make sure you got the original purchase receipt.
 No it does not have weights. It feels a bit light but the feel is good. Cant remember the warranty, but Im sure it has one.
 + / - Im not sure mouse3 (wheel click) mouse4 (back on internet) mouse5 (forward on internet) I know those work. The others might with the Logitech driver stuff installed. I just PnP mine.
 This mouse does not have native software support for Windows XP; although--aside from possibly the Logitech gaming software--this mouse should still plug and play. This is a best guess based on experiences, but not a guarantee.
 They are just a different color.

 The G510 is like any normal keyboard, not especially clacky on the key strokes (not like mechanical switches).
 It is difficult to measure, due to the beveled edges, but it measures 20 5/16 inches (20.31).
 I must have gotten a lemon. Mine broke between the ear cup and the head band after 13-months. It was only ever used at my desk, and I typically handled it with care.
 The frustration free packaging is just the headphones in a plastic sleeve cushioned by foam. You dont need to cut any plastic, just open the box and it is good to go.
 No it does not work without the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter. Which will run you about another $30 bucks
 The Amp is not necessary for PC but you lose the ability to adjust the volume in-line. You would have to use your computer volume instead, plus you lose quite a bit of cord length as the cord from the amp/volume box is only about 3 ft long.
 * Unplug them from the box thingy, and plug them right into your GamePad. Control the volume from the gamepad. * Plug them to the box thingy. Use the included adapter to get the audio from your TVs RCA audio output (or use a WiiU Component cable, set the audio in your Wii U to _both_ HDMI and component, and get the audio from there), and plug the USB to your TV or another power source. Now you can use the box thingy to adjust volume, equalize bass/treble, and also to plug in your phone/tablet (extra cable included) so you can Skype while you Smash!

 you can hear with them, but the microphone doesnt work with the Xbox One. Youd have to use the Kinect mic to talk.
 I use mine for a Mac and it works wirelessly. Im not so sure about a PC but Id assume so.
 Yes works on ps4 pc and xbox 360 just fine
 One year just like a brand new one
 Yes
 It comes with a very long cord, 10 feet(I measured it)...and the cable is not like the plastic ones, it is more like a nylon cord. Great quality for the price
 You will need to purchase a USB adapter. Most recent Macs have a 3.5mm line level input, but the mic will not work without an amplifier or phantom power. The G430 has the adapter included. You can purchase the G430s adapter on an auction site. It will allow you to use the G230 with a USB port.
 I encourage you to ask questions on actual USB sound card products instead.

 as long as something is playing yes , but if nothing is playing in the headset u can still hear your surroundings but very dim voice
 Hmm, I didnt try this until I saw this question. Mine works ok on my glass desk if the desk is slightly dirty from normal use, but after cleaning the desk with Windex the mouse no longer tracks.
 In comparison a mouse set to a lower dpi will move slower on screen(exp.400dpi will move the pointer 400 pixles for every 1 inch the mouse moves where as 2000dpi can cover a whole 1080i screen with only an inch of mouse movement). Lower dpi can be usefull when an action requires more precise control and higher is great for when the pointer has to travel far and wide.
 No, it has its own receiver and does not work with Logitechs unifying receiver.
 The logitech software works on Mac. All functions work on Mac.
 Yes, and its just as audible as the left/right wheel clicks.
 Only redeemable once
 no I ordered the limited edition and got the Normal version no Code.
 Almost the same the different is it has free extra mission
 Well it came New (unopened) but Im unsure what exactly you mean by Factory sealed
//forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-DS4-To-XInput-Wrapper
 no
 I believe the answer to that is to save on cost, and the fact that the PS4 and almost every other device nowadays comes with a USB cord. Personally, I just use my cell phone charger if Im not using the usb cord that came with the PS4.
//www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/02/ps4-controllers-now-work-wirelessly-with-ps3-consoles Good news! The DS4 now works on the PS3 wirelessly. I can only assume that it would work for GTA5 on the PS3 as well, but MAYBE some of the special features with the PS4 version wont work--like the light in the back of the DS4 reflecting the actions of the game. Im not sure if that would work on the PS3, might, might not, dont know.
 Well after getting the console, I can confirm that the controller WILL charge from a wall charger, however it HAS to be a 1 amp plug. That belkin one I listed above it 2.1 amp and it will NOT work on that or the other 3 2.1 amp wall chargers I have, and it will NOT work on the like 4 .5 amp chargers I have either. It will however work on my new phone and new portable Bluetooth speakers wall chargers, which are both 1 Amp. I guess something in the controller wont kick in to charge unless its receiving exactly 1 Amp. Of course needing to charge one from a wall socket near you while playing becomes a moot point once you get a charging stand and a 2nd controller to swap to.
 in some ways yes in others no. kinect has more voice commands. (for now) also in the future give or take a few years Sony will come out with a VR headset the works with the camera
 SMH! Sadly there are not that many so far (Just Dance), its useless in my opinion if all you can do as of the moment is use it in the playroom and Just Dance
 Yeah but limited, playstation doesnt really focus gaming around camera compared to xbox
 Yes
 I assume you mean face scan technology for NBA 2K15, If so then yes you can use the playstation 4 camera for it

 Yes you can play 2 players on knack.
 I feel that it would be a good game for kids. It doesnt have any blood or gore. Its more along the lines of the old fashioned type video games.
 It depends. Knack is a difficult game that feels like it came out of the 80s or 90s. Knack has simple controls that are easy to learn but hard to master. Its the super Mario bros of beatem ups. Its pretty bare bones, but its really fun despite its jumbled story. If you just started gaming then you could at least do easy mode, but as someone who has been gaming all my life I found the game difficult. If you have ps+ Id say wait. It is sure to be the first retail game on the service on ps4. If you want a challenge though, this is your game.
 Its a platformer. Not a whole lot of strategy. Think of Ratchet & Clank (without guns), or Jak & Daxter. If you liked those two, and you can excuse the overall simplicity of the game, it should be right up your ally.

 Unfortunately no, this new class is appearing in the expansion The Reaper of Souls . With a heavy metal salute (devil horns) play on my friend!
 yes I play the game by my self but you do go on line but just pick play by your self and pick who you want to be. as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007
 From what I have read, Blizzard (who publish Diablo games), have region locked the languages to wherever you bought the game. So, the version bought in America has English only, the version bought in Spain or South America will have Spanish or Portugese.
 It is worth it. I never played the multiplayer one bit. I only played the campaign and it was amazing. I have recently been thinking of getting it again to play thru again. but if your looking for an amazing campaign this game has it. I highly recommend it.
 You can play offline in single player compaign. Multiplayer mode can only be played online.
 I know is that this only disc
 unfortunately there is no co-op mode. You can play online matches with other players but not anything local or split screen.
 Yes
 No, its a Third-Person Shooter.

 I dont think EA is interested in helping anyone who uses a Mac. I had a Mac and could not play with Pets because of the horse issue, which to my knowledge still isnt fixed. They make the greatest games on earth, but theyre glitchy, buggy, and dont work right half the time. I will not be buying Sims 4 either.
 When we got the cd it had an activation code on a card inside the box. You can use the code on origin to register and play through an origin account.
 Yes

 Yes. However, be wary of Island Paradise. It freezes often and you have to reset the Sim every time.

 The cover (in the case) of the game has a code. You need to input that code in redeem code either on the PSN store or the game menu. The content is not added by default, but available only to those who purchase a new copy of the game or are lucky enough that the previous owner did not use the code. The missions you should get are CTRL, ALT, DELETE, and SHUT DOWN. These are sequential so dont be surprised if you only see one.
 what copy did u get?
 Im sorry but Chinese does not appear to be one of the options. I had my son check.

 The game is cool, worth every penny

 If you mean that It will stop when charging is done, the answer is yes.
 Yes it has all you need to recharge 2 Wii remotes.
 Yeah it is compatible with both the remote plus and the regular/old one.
 Unfortunately, it does not. Basically the charging port is only made for an exact perfect fit for a regularly licensed Nintendo Pro Controller. I have not found a third party one that will fit. I own the Afterglow and Nyko versions as well. You may want to look around at Toys R US, they have 90% clearance on the Nyko Controller docking station with I believe fits it.
 Mini controller? Not sure what is meant here, but it charges 2x wiimotes, a Wii u gamepad, and a pro controller simultaneously. Hope this helps

 Of what I know, they do save. But I havent moved this keyboard so I really dont know. The reason I think it would save is because of profiles.
 I havent had any problems with dust affecting the functionality, but its black, and it has gloss black parts, so it shows dust. Any dust.
 The space bar is louder but still very quiet compared to a mechanical keyboard
 Yes to both questions.
 Three wire fans have pwm (pulse width modulation), which means there voltage can be controlled digitally. Two wire fans just have positive and negative inputs
 You have the manufacturing warranty only. One year.
 My BitFenix Recon (BFA-RCN-KS-RP) product box says 15W Max Watts / Channel. Doesnt have a Rev. #
 As B. Tipton said, no violence and you will learn how to train all breeds of dogs. There is exciting DLC that features Cesar Millan, and you work beside him on 3 intense levels where you try to get this Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever and Treeing Walker Coonhound to not fight while company is over.
 No there is no cross gen play
 Its not a PS 4 exclusive, that 1 hour of content is a Playstation exclusive. Look at the case covers for both the PS3 and PS4 versions, they couldve worded that better, as in Playstation instead of PS3 or PS4. Both versions get it (and its not a pre order bonus), Xbox or PC doesnt.

 My slim does not fit in this case. I think if I pushed real hard i could get it in there but not going to do that. I may do a little cutting to make room as it is a great case.
 Its made only for the first ps vita model. Not psp slim or ps vita slim
 No. It wont fit
 4
 No, just the Vita.
 no recuerdo creo que si la trae
 Super slim
 Yes

 I havent had an issue with that personally. That is only going to be an issue if you dont maximize the mouses potential at a higher dpi setting anyways. I usually have right in the middle which I believe is 4200dpi? Anyways one of the best mice I have ever owned especially for the price. Havent had a single issue with it
 Yes
\\
 Yes, Just download the software for the mouse and you can change the +/- into whatever action you would like. I\ve done the same on Battlefield and it works great.
 Yes.. I think all mice are compatible with all Operating Systems.
 Yes. Also there are achievements and missions that can only be completed online.
 I have found no parental controls. In the options, under the video heading, there is a a place to turn the blood on or off. When the blood option is off, you still hear the sound of your weapon and your target still makes some disturbing gurgling noises and writhes in pain. By language, I assume you mean adult language. I haven\t seen an option to adjust adult language. You could turn the voice volume to zero, or the language option to French or Spanish, but you would miss some necessary dialog along with a very few F bombs.
 Yeah. It looks great.
 This is a single player game. There is multiplayer for online only. It supports the gamepad & classic controller pro.
 No, my disc specifically says for the Americas only, so presumably this is NTSC.
 Yes and no. If you ever played AC games things are blocked off until you finish missions same goes here but theres a lot of exploring to do and collectibles. The good news is after you get your ship and can customize it you can free roam about 90% of the game (hunt for buried treasure, underwater wrecks, hunt animals and get into naval battles). Its not exactly open world like Skyrim.
 No
 Pretty much the same. I really dont think 3rd person mp can exist in an industry of fps shooters. If it was like gtas mp. Im sure theyd be better off. Co-op would be a better choice. Mp matches in ac is dismal as well. Hopefully this answers your question
 Game play no, graphics yes.
 Ps4 is the most recommended, the WII U does not support high graphical games
 Psn codes are region sensitive, so you have to have a psn account of the same region of the amazon you get your code from, so form this one you do need a us psn account.

 My son says the later games are less repetitious and more fleshed out. Hope that helps.
 Yes, there is spanish audio and subtitles
 It should work just fine on Windows 8. Back of the box says vista/7/8.

 Not obligatory, just you can play without conection but if you conect to internet can unblock some facilities.
 We dont play it online, but sometimes it is really slow. Sorry, I dont have a clue. Perhaps your internet speed slowed down? Good luck finding the answer.
 You can play through the entire single-player campaign without an Xbox live account or membership
 I had the opportunity to compare and I think the difference is plotted on XBOX ONE minimally higher compared to XBOX 360. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is not yet XBOX ONE which should be an eighth generation video game.
 yes spanish for sure I have not tried french.
 It takes up 1.10Gb of space.
 There is a multi-player option, yet I have not tried it yet.
 The cord is shorter than the original. At about 6 feet, its too short for most couch configurations, and there is no extension. Not sure about the warranty, but I ordered 2 and I had to send one back because it was DOA. These are cheaply made, but hey, what do you expect for $8.
 No, they arent, and mine already broke, so the quality is questionable as well.
 Installation DVDs and a flyer with the activation code
 Hello Belinda, this game when you get it and install it forces you to use Uplay to install it again pretty much. If you want it on Steam you have to buy it in the Steam store, however it will still force you to install on Uplay. Hope this helped!
 Assassins creed games, GTA5 (not out yet on PC), just cause 2 (kind of similar)
 Yes but... It needs to be SP2 64bit and If youre running vista, you likely have an old graphics card. This needs a pretty good card. Read the specs before buying otherwise it wont run and most sellers dont accept returns on PC games.
 I havent bought a cd rom since 2007. If I was you I would download it

 Nope but some faction in greek culture can be playable
 Yes it is! The best computer game I have ever played! I have been playing computer games for 18 years!
 It says that its not on steam, but isnt that the mode where you are rome in three different areas?
 Steam activation codes and physical copies are two different things so if you want a steam code you should buy one that specifically states that. Thank you for your inquire.
 well if u want to waste ur money, it might but, my it guy that does repair said that this program is a pc killr of drive space
 I dont remember where I got the driver but I downloaded a zip file. With it there is a button for it on the bottom right row of buttons. Clicking on it brings up a window with a picture of the mouse with each of the mouses buttons identified. You can program the buttons for any of the functions that are supported or you can disable buttons.
 Its a usb 3.0 so it fits most if not all computer ports
 I have done this and yes it does work, but I notice that the adapter for the wave bird tends to fall out. So it does work as long as it stays in.
 Yes you should be able to, you just need a GC controller for each adaptar
 Honestly, the device is wonky sometimes and typically takes a minute to work. Afterwards itll work without a hitch, though!
 Double tap start button for proceeding and hold start button for home menu
 only 1. But dont buy this if you dont own a Wii remote control. It will not connect directly to a Wii U, which is why I had to return mine. False advertisement, and waste of time.

 I have a moto x and it works, so it should work. My phone is not rooted
 I would like to say yes because the gs5 is only marginally wider than the lg g2 (which i use) and i know for a fact that the clamp stretches further than my phones width.
 With my Galaxy S5 width at 2.85 inches it looks like theres just about another inch of space for a bigger phone.
 Push x then home once the light stops blinking its connected
 Yes

 The LL is the Japanese name of our 3ds XL (same size as the American 3dsXL). Yes I still have the box for it. When I had gotten my new 3ds it did not come with a charger (I believe it is stated that it wouldnt in the product description) however any American 3ds charger will work for it. Also just as a warning any 3ds game that you want to play have to be from the Japanese region ds games should be fine from any region though. Hope that helps. Feel free to contact me again if you have any other questions.
 Yes you will get the voucher
 I checked in settings and on the bottom right it says Ver. 7.2.0-17J
 Yes. The language is Japanese and my copy was shipped from Japan, but I have not had any trouble playing it on my US console.
 No, but it does have online multiplayer. Co-op only.
 Not sure at all, the game functions and plays normally. Likely a description of what one may do with it, add it to your collection/stockpile
 unfortunately no, some of the menus have english below the japanese but other than that not really. one point though is its easy to figure out even with it being in japanese

 For me it made my trigger finger faster it just takes time getting used to. Yes its some what of a mod but the pros use them
 There isnt much you can do if you want to keep the trigger stop in, but an alternative could be to take the trigger stop out of that trigger only, which would still allow you to use it on the other trigger.
 Dont waste your money, all they did was screw in some allen wrench screw into the same trigger that was already in your controller.
 I dont believe you get as much as you would with the PC version, but it does have red stone with all the levers & buttons
 It does have the ability to play up to Four Players, but only if youre running your xbox 360 via HDMI Cable, otherwise it is Single Player.
 No. To get the new updates you would need to have internet to download them.
 Yes, with the disk you can play offline, but there are not as many features as online. The disk is still fun offline though.

 I had asked my nephew and he said, Yes it is.
 All you heard is correct and no it isnt worth buying. In fact, it has very little to do with the movies.
 yes but you cannot drift. my grandson liked it except for the drifting.
 No
 Yes. It does not require gold, but you do need to be a member of Xbox live to redeem the code. If you do not want to pay for gold you can simply make a free silver account.
 You have to wait for it to be shipped to your house.
 Yeah, save data is on the hard drive and can be accessed by the games on demand version or disk version, or both!
 Well its ment for a PC not an Xbox.
 Microsoft does not offer a driver for the chromebook, so ultimately no. You may be able to find a 3rd party driver that could force it to work however that can be risky.
 Yes it supports up to 4

 Yep
 I dont see why not since its a game download, not a physical copy with region restrictions.
 I use Win7 64bit and this game runs great.
 I dont believe so. You are stuck signing up and downloading origin, their version of steam.

 Yea it should since the ps3 isnt region coded.
 The game only supports cross-save but not cross-play. You have to buy both the PS3 and the Vita version if you want to play on both systems. But your saved game on the Vita CAN be used on the PS3 and vice versa.
 no is does not but if you have a ps4 i would recomend you purchase the ps4 version it has better colors and full native 1080p.
 Limited comes with artbook and different case. Both the limited and the standard are the international version so you wont miss much getting the standard.
 The differences are that the Collectors Edition doesnt come in a game case, like the Limited Edition, but unlike the standard. It is all one huge book. The art book is much bigger than the Limited Edition artbook. Has 40 pages where the LE artbook only has 24 and is smaller. The CE also comes with the soundtrack on blu ray and 5 lithographic art prints that are about the size of a sheet of paper.
 Yes. This is just an expansion pack.
(
 Yes. You can not download other without steam.
 The expansion rewrites over the game data so the expansion needs all 8 gb. To answer your question it is just for the expansion.
 You could choose PC Download or the Mac Download (depends on which you have), if you cannot use the disc, it has a online game code.
 Yes, I have both and it works fine
 It is the actual disc. It worked with steam.
 No you do not need the gods and king explanation pack to play it will fine without.
 There is an option for Mac. But it is download only. Hope this helps.

 Yes
 Only if the expansion you want to add is an expansion of The Sims 3, otherwise you will have to get the starter version of the expansion you bought
 Actual Sims 3 with 2 expansions &#128522;
 You need to go into the origin account you created to play the game and make sure you install all updates before attempting to play or game will have issues. You can access all your sim stuff on origin you may have to enter license code but once its there you can access it from anywhere.

 I am sure it is compatible with MacBook or any laptop. But I wouldnt know for sure because mine broke in less than 3 months, before I could use it on other devices.
 No I doesnt need to be connected with the control You could do It but thats up to you
 The headset is self only has a micro USB port for charging. The wireless base has a 3.5 mm jack. This means the base needs a power source (wall plug), but can be used with a mobile device. Just not very practical for mobile use. Ive never used a50, so I cant compare them.
 Yes I believe allows 7.1 and I have the same headphones and it works really well. I hope this helps

 Blackgate which from what I remember takes place after the story of Arkham Origins. It is a different game entirely. It is in a 2D/3D mode. It has less fighting and more exploring of buildings and puzzles. It was an ok game.
 Nope no game for the ps3 can be played on the ps4 also goes for the xbox 360
 The one I got did come with the Deathstroke Challenge Pack.
 well when i bought it from amazon it was the digital version. they just gave me the code through an email. and when i redeemed it on psn i had to download the game then install it. once i launched the game there was a mandatory data install as well.
 There should be a code for deathstroke. If there not make sure the one you purchased was not used. If the one you bought is new contact game developer
 Nope, not for the PC version. I do recommend an analog controller to take advantage of the shooting and passing features. (if you use those features)
 Windows 7.
 yes
 No, Im sorry I dont have Mac version.
 No is not needed, but a cotroller is cheap and i think it enhances the gameplay a lot
 As far as i know, no
 Yes if you have 2 controllers (or someone wants to use mouse and keyboard.) you could easily play play multiplayer (splitscreen).
 yes you can
 Could be that you need to update your drivers. Or try reinstalling the game.

 I use mine on my iMac running mountain lion and it works great for me.
 I play League and SC2 with it no problem!

 No, due to LED failure faults with this model, Corsair has discontinued and moved on to K70 RGB
 Mine havent and Ive got weeks of total use out of it.
 2.0 but i plugged it into 3.0 & it worked too.
 Yes I have, about twenty four of mine failed after some time...
 They work great, I see lots of people complaining that they burn out or die quickly but Ive had mine for 6 months now with no issues. I keep mine on the lowest setting as its bright enough.
 The design of the keys arent like traditional keyboards where you push down a key, and it goes below some hole. On the K70, the aluminum plate you see IS the bottom plate for all the keys. Not only does this design allow for easy cleaning, but the way the back light LEDS shine will also be reflected off of the aluminum body, giving it a very nice glow under/around each key. I spilled a drop or 2 of orange juice on the keyboard the first day i got it, and it landed not on top of any keys but rather under them. I simply used the included key puller and removed the keys near the spillage, and cleaned it up real easy.
 Yes yes yes! Its so worth the money! My boyfriend has one and I got one too! He games and plays Battlefield 4 mostly and he has had a lot of keyboards, none compare to this one! I dont even game and I had to have it! Im very picky with my keyboards & this one is perfect! Volume control, lights up red so its easy to see even in the dark, amazing quality, etc! Highly recommend!
 I too read the reports and was concerned about this. Im happy to report that after 6 months of use all is still working well. Corsair was aware of the issue and it appears they have adjusted their manufacturing accordingly.

 Yes, but this game is terrible, it is not like any other FIFA 14 game. I played it 3 days and then put it away and never played it again. I have every copy of FIFA since FIFA06 and have played hundreds if not thousands of hours. DONT BUY THIS GAME! NO COMPRE ESTE JUEGO..ES MALISIMO, NO ES NADA COMO LOS OTRO FIFA, MEJOR ESPERAR PARA EL NUEVO FIFA15...ESTE ES MALISIMO, NISIQUIERA LO JUEGO YA.
 I dont recommend playing with a move controller
 Im not sure because my kids dont have the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, but I think the later is a special edition issued little before the 2014 world cup started and updated to include players and teams which were about to participate in that specific tournament.
 This version as well as 2013 version is fully Move compatible. Though I doubt you will be able to execute the full array of moves without a standard controller.
 As a franchise player as well, if you are on a PS3 I would go with Fifa 13.

 Im not sure if thats a serious question. The game features multiple game modes. You can play online, start a manager career or a player career, exhibition matches and skill games.
 If its new, u have no problem... U certainly enjoy it... But used u wil regret as I used a used one, which looked like new just for a week
 Yes desire this game come With french language
 Spanish & English
 Very good

 Its a perfect replacement, K95 is very neat keyboard. Ive switched from G15 to K95. I miss a little screen at first, but I used it as clock most of the time.
 Yes of course, any combination of keys can be pressed for the macros.
 Depends on what youre using the keyboard for, I guess. The k70 had the option to go with cherry red switches (better for gaming), blue switches (balanced for typing and gaming) or brown switches (better for typing, good for gaming)... the k90 comes with the cherry reds, and it has 18 programmable keys. If you use it for gaming, and youll make use of the programmable keys then the k90 is a better keyboard. If your k70 has cherry reds then the only real difference will be the programmable keys.
 Yes
 Yes, I upgraded 2 of my machines and MS Windows 8.1 had no issues with my K95 and M95 devices. I did download and install the latest drivers from Corsair in order to have the full set of utilities installed.

 No but with black ops 2 you can download it on a xbox compatible usb drive 16 gig recommended.
 Yes
 Yes you do.
 In offline you can play split screen or the zombies mode and u can play 4 players
 Im....not sure what you are asking. This is a corded usb headset, which means, you can use them on anything that has a USB port.
 Yes they work for wii U, pc, 3ds, ds, ps3, ps4, xbox 360, ipods, and iphones
 It has everything you need to plug into the 360.

 Yeah, I play with my friend everyday. even four people can play, 2 on each team.
 Nautico, Ponte Preta, Portuguesa, & Vasco da Gama are still in the Serie A of Brazil in Game. In reality it should be Criciuma, Coritiba, Chapecoense, & Figueirense. I didnt go into dept in Argentina and Colombian Leagues since its not as familiar to me, but it is fair to assume the same will be the case.
 of course my friend
 Yes
 This years version is very similar to previous versions in terms of controls. Small differences like ball physics tweaks are new but are only going to cause issues if youre very familiar with an old FIFA title. But I find this one to be easier than 11 for example and very similar to 13. The learning curve is not steep in my opinion. If youve never played FIFA you might get bugged that not everything is going exactly the way you want right away, but after some practice youll find you can score in creative ways and really enjoy the game

 You would absolutely be able to continue! The DLC comes on the disk and all you do is install it onto your system, it will go right along with your saves.
 No.only for updates
 No difference at all. Make sure if you want all the downloadable content that you buy the LEGENDARY EDITION.
 Skyrim Legendary Edition is the best version to get because it comes with all DLC released for the game.
 Yes, the dlc comes within the game; its just like downloading the game to your ps3 and the dlc you have to download from your cd to your ps3 seperately.
)
 No, all of the content can be played going forward. If you were level 40 or above it might not be as fun but thats a low enough level it will be no problem.
 If you really explore everything there is to offer in the game, it can get Mature. For an average player just playing the game it shouldnt be a problem. However if you try really hard you can encounter some Gore in battles and in cut scenes, you can experience some really cartoony drug/alcohol use, There is some language, and down right immoral values through out. However, I have played for hours and never seen anything sexual about the game at all.
 As long as it is legendary edition of skyrim, with the 2 discs. 1 disc being the actual game disc and the second disk being the DLC content. Used or new as long as you have those 2 discs
 Not at all, the game does have some history based on the previous game but that doesnt matter to how you play at all and there it no character carry over like in mass effect. It will take you weeks to play all of the quests and find everything. Have fun!
 I just tested my Game Stop Brand Xbox 360 controller with usb converter on my Windows 7 64-bit PC, and it worked perfectly. I personally think the game is significantly easier to play with a keyboard and mouse, but yes, you are perfectly capable of playing with the controller. (Other operating systems may or may not work [I have no experience with Windows 8 nor previous versions]). If you have a different operating system, I recommend looking it up on google, or asking another person before you buy the game. P.S. If you need help setting up your controller, just let me know, or there may be tutorials online.
 When I installed the game, I had to log into my steam acct and validate. It also had to download updates. After install, you can choose to play offline.
 Yes, I currently run mine on Windows 8.
 PC - Download, its a digital code that you redeem on steam, you will have to then download the whole game. PC - Version it the game itself on DVD.
 You can redeem it on steam. If it takes 14hrs to download, then your internet is way too slow.
 The wheel clicks left and right so I suppose you could program it to the arrows.
 The base G500 had problems that the G500s has, in my experience, corrected. Especially regarding the mouse-wheel/middle-mouse button problem. Still not as good as the G5, but its worked well for me so far.
 no the button clicks are normal. Be advised though that with any mouse in a high intensity clicking game (Diablo for one) the clicking can become problematic. One thing to be advised about is the mouse wheel. This puppy can spin fast and when you have it do measured option it can get really loud. Without the measured option on though it is noiseless. Side buttons and top buttons are near silent.
 By default its just a generic programmable button. I set it to act as the mouse wheel click, because I dont like clicking the mouse wheel. You can set it to practically anything you want through the software though, like keystrokes or macros. Hope that helps!
 If you can hear 15kHz frequencies, you may hear a high-pitched whine from the mouse when not moving it. This is due to some engineering problems with the ceramic capacitors used in the mouse.
 This game is easy for anyone to play. Im sure he will love it once he plays the game.
 Yes, he is an unlock able character when you complete the wrestlemania challenges. There also seems to another ultimate warrior you can purchase
 You relive 30 years of wrestlemania & to finish each era you will have different objectives to complete inorder to continue but there are some that are optional. If youre like me that loves to collects trophies/achievements, then you might want to try to every objective because there is a achievement/trophy in doing so. But like i said some are optional while others are mandatory. I hope this answers your question
 No
 Yup, hes in there.
 You can take the fight outside the wrestling ring but not into the stands.
 Sin Cara is in 2k14 most likely 15 as well
 Probably, I didnt really play the online yet myself, Im sure other people know the answer, I just basically reviewed it based on the gameplay, animations, speed, graphics, roster, features, controls etc. based on my opinion, I dont know much about the online aspect even though I do have XBOX Live but the really cool part of this game if you have XBOX Live that I do know is downloading the created wrestlers that people made that arent in the game, thats pretty awesome and I like that, of course its better if they make them in the game but if they dont you can download peoples creations but I didnt really play online myself and from what I hear about the new WWE 2K15 at least the XBOX 360 version that just came out is that its really not impressive at all even though people had high hopes for it cause the roster is smaller plus they didnt really make much improvements and they took out other features and only improved on a couple things so 2K15 lost more than it gained this year I have read on the XBOX 360 anyways, the only really good thing about it is the addition of Sting which is awesome of course cause hes a legend and really popular but supposedly they are going to have more improvements for the XBOX ONE and PS4 Versions when those versions come out soon and they want everyone to buy a new system which is kindof sad, in my view if they put out a new game they should make it as good as possible on all systems or not even release it so 2K14 is probably better to buy if you have a 360 and not a XBOX ONE or PS4 in my view plus its way cheaper now in comparison and you can download created versions of Sting anyways and all the other packs of wrestlers that you can buy so the roster can be really big with a lot of legends and current guys, no game has everyone that you want but 2K14 comes pretty close roster wise, hopefully 2K15 will be better on the new systems cause I heard its underwhelming on the 360 but 2K14 is alright, good roster, lots of features but the movements of the wrestlers, controls, speed, gameplay etc. TO ME could be a lot better like the N64 games they had a lot better gamplay to me, if they could make modern day versions of wrestling games with a grapple system like No Mercy or Wrestlemania 2000 from the N64 it would be AWESOME!
 Yes and coop
 My son has updated his Xbox and his game still works. I think that you need to contact Xbox Customer Support.
 Yes. It only supports HDMI. Good news for you though. There are adapters out there that might allow you to convert to Component if need be. Just Google search, HDMI to Component(or whatever you want).
 Yes, you will get one wireless controller and Kinect system with the Xbox one.
 so far they have not released anything about making the games backwards compatible. Sadly to say I am pretty sure they arent going to make them backwards compatible.
 The only games that will not play without a internet is online only games like titan fall and plants vs zombies plants warfare. Any game that has to connect to a server will not work. All other games disc based games will work like assassin cred and call of duty those games.
 Mine did not, that was when they came out though

 Yes, you will still receive the achievement. Its a little QR code that you scan into the Kinect.
 No.
 A massive upgrade ergonomically. The buttons feel more mechanical and precise and the joysticks have a really nice texture to the top of them. The triggers are a little bigger and the battery pack no longer sticks out of the controller, everything is internal. Honestly a complete upgrade.

 No it doesnt, I recommend the Nyko brand ones. Theyre just as good as the Microsoft ones.
 Yes you do and you cant use your USBs it must be the USB that the charging pack comes with I just tried myself and it wasnt charging but I guess its kind of good because the one it comes with tells you when its done charging
 Yes this has the campaign mode
 There is a setting on Steam, that allows you to play offline. I think if you choose the game and Polk around on Steams settings you can find it, plus Steam has that question and answer on their website.
 Most computers will automatically set it for the best option. But you can always go in and manually do it. Mine usually sets it down one setting from the highest resolution setting.
 Yes
 If u uninstall steam, u wont be able to play it...the game runs via steam site

 You can use a xbox 360 wired controller. Or if you have a ps3 controller you can download motionjoy and make the ps3 controller emulate a 360 controller. That is if the ps3 controller is not recognized.
 No this is for windows based computers

 No

 Minimum system requirements on my packaging are Windows XP, Vista, 7; Processor AMD Athlon X2 4800 or Intel Pentium D dual core 2.8 GHz or better; 256 MB NVidia GeForce 8000 GT/ ATI Radeon X1800; 8 GB free HD space, 1 GB RAM for XP, 2 GB RAM for Vista and 7; DirectX 9.0c compatible 16 bit sound card; 6x speed DVD-ROM. I have Intel i5 4670K 3.4 GHz processor, NVidia GTX 660 video card,, Windows 7 64 bit, and 8 Mg RAM. The game runs very well at high resolutions, good frame rates. I dont have a separate sound card, I use the sound built into my motherboard, which is very good.
 No
 that is what I have and it works beautifully. Just remember the system requirements for this including i7, big graphics card, etc.
 A web site you join to play Wolf and others. You dont het Wolf with this buy.
 Its the full price and game. Its not entirely terrible if you get for Xbox One or PS4. Its not bad on Xbox 360 or PS3, just the graphics have been severely dumbed down. The story and gameplay are what really matter.
 Each level is its own mission, you have to complete each of the levels to move on to the next.
 Roughly 24 to 28 hours
 not that im aware of its the same game for each of the consoles it is on and there is no online multiplayer
 no
 The 3 discs are stacked together on a single spindle. All the discs in my copy were in perfect condition, so storing the discs together like this seems to be OK.
 You do not need an internet connection for the single player.
 According to the information, this game requires an Intel 7 series or better to operate. I purchased the game without know the required equipment. I wasnt prepared to spend the additional monies to bring my system up to par...( in excess of 400.00) so, I plan on selling it back to Amazon since places like Game Stop etc. do not buy PC games anymore.
 Mine is the nsta USA version. Ive heard the one in Germany removed all references to Nazis. I think thats a PAL region. But mine is for the US and think it has regional restrictions.
 There are a few sex scenes that dont show private parts, and cursing.
 Refurbished products carry a 90 day warranty. These are authentic headphones that have been refurbished.
 The xp 400s do not allow music over bluetooth, only calls. You can pair the head set with your phone. You can answer calls and end them from the head set. The calls do come through on both ears, and I have never found ay way to use siri
 You can run the audio through your TV..use the optical out on the TV.
 Yeah - get the cable and forgo true wireless - LOL! Wish there was something else, but that little puck shuts off whenever it feels like it. It isnt just when there is no voice activity like TB will try to tell you, mine used to shut off in the middle of me speaking - before I said to heck with it and started using the cable from my old x32s
 You get to create your own power saves on the pro version. The bad part is that they both dont play a lot of games unless try were update recently. I tried pokemon x, animal crossing new leaf, and donkey kong. Only donkey kong workerd.
 They are the same! Action replay simply rebranded the same device for USA with the word PRO. This device is TRULY awesome. Saving 700 hour play file of Animal Crossing to my PC was a relief!
 it works in all the games if not update xD
 Yes, once I bought one and it was from Us so it didnt match with my Gamecard because Im from Europe so I asked datel so switch to European and they did it. I hope I could help.
 No, this is only for modifying saves, and only what is available from the codejunkies website.
 You dont need windows. The game has Mac version. Go and download Origin, then find your game and type in your key number. The game will be installed automatically.
 The whole download did not work for me
 No
 Make sure you have an Origin account. When you open up Origin you look on the top left of your Mac screen and you should see where it says Games when you click on it you will see where it says Redeem product code. Type in the code that they provided you with after buying the game on Amazon. Then you\ll find it under the My Games section on Origin click on the game and it should give you the option to download. Hope this helps.
 You have to have Origin - EAs game launcher.

 Play Station has stopped supporting the on line races that they used to provide every month in GT5. I would buy a used GT6 game if you like the time trials. GT6 did not provide any extra races on the online part like GT5 did other than stupid time trials. I thought it was easier to tune your cars in GT5 and had over 700 cars that I owned. GT6 is harder to earn lots of money and there isnt many cars that you can win. (maybe 20) I havent played it in several months as I got bored with it, something that didnt happen with GT5. If you have a large garage full of cars with GT5 then it would be good to own it again if you can buy it at a decent price. The racing dynamics are not noticeably better with GT6 and some think it is actually worse than GT5. I know Sony is still tweaking it to make it better like they did with GT5. It might be worth while to get it if you can buy it cheap. Certainly not $50 like I paid for it when it came out. Maybe 25 to 30 dollars would be reasonable. Hope this helped you.

 There is no co-op.
 Yeah, the in game menu has several spoken language options as well as subtitle options...
 no, it is just suggested adult theme behind it. The language can be rough though. There are a few \F bombs scattered throughout it.

 Yes its the complete base. After you dl the game and go to Square Enix and create an account and go to log in the game it dls the patches for any and all updates!
 Your character will be on both. Its tied to an account not PC/ps4
 Well yeah it have its own many story line. A lots of sidequest. Best of all. It will never be pay to win. Got to put some effort to get the best things.

 You can play up to 8 Im pretty sure, however, playing more than two people is difficult and annoying because one player for each team is usually optimal.

 If free-scrolling is the kind you can flick and it keeps spinning, then no - its an incremental click scroll.
 Theres only 3 levels and theyre preset, no granular control. The buttons right below the mouse wheel is what controls the DPI. I cant remember what the numbers were but the highest was over 1k.
 Yes, you are able to turn the Corsair glow off if you want through the software that you download from their website.
 Yes, there are two discs. Disc 1 is the installation disc. Disc 2 is the play disc, meaning you have to have it in the X-Box while you are playing the game.
 I would say no, I really didnt know how bad it was until I started playing it. The language and sexual references and actual sexual content, I feel make this game much worse than a rated R movie. The game itself and free play world are amazing, I wish you could edit the other stuff out.
 8gb is required to play the game. I would get this for a 11yr old. My daughter is 13 and I just bought it for her. I think as long as the children who play this game knows right from wrong and is respectful, then it should be okay. I would buy the game from Xbox store instead of amazon. My daughters game only worked 1 day. Now I have to buy her another one. I could of returned it for an exchange of a new one but she threw away the box and label.
 No because, there is less to do on Assassins creed. It also has a smaller area than GTA V where as GTA V has a huge world with variety of gameplay. But this is just my opinion and I feel that kids and young teenagers should buy Assassins creed due to GTA V having a lot of profanity in it. If GTA could tone that down then GTA V is for me a 100% fun time.
 This is made for USA made consoles. So it probably wouldnt work for any other country.
 Not to my knowledge but you can google it. I saw some youtube videos where you can change the language, so do some digging.
 DLC has to be redeemed through the psn store, even if its the gotye. You should receive a 12 digit code to redeem for dlc, or purchase it separately in the store
 It includes the game, with a code for the digital download. Yes.
 Yes, Thanks
 No
 YES , you can play this game OFF LINE , these people dont know what they are talking about. The game has game save issues , but if you disconnect your console from the internet and play it like you would any other game your game saves will work because its not going through EAs servers then to cloud saving. All of your saves will go directly to the hard drive like they are supposed to. If you get busted by a cop or just wreck your car to much and are automatically sent back to the garage , make sure you exit the garage and come back in again because the game does not save when those two things happen. Always visit a garage before shuting down your console because that is the only way to save. Just play off line to avoid losing you save game data. Also dont listed to anyone that tells you there is no off line play because there is and the game functions the exact same way as it does online except you dont have live players running around it is just the game AI drivers which is all I need because the game is still tons of fun even without the online feature. Everything you can do online , you can do off line Except race live players.
 Not sure what a Hear drive is. All i have is an Xbox1 with no Kinect and it works as it should.
 Yes, great game. Very kid friendly also.
 I think the original would be ok as long as your 6 year old isnt going to be devastated by the loss of an earned vehicle. The open road and easy controls do provide an excellent means of entertainment.
 Yes
 Hmmm I cant say anything for the ps4 version cause I only have the xbone, but the only bug Ive encountered thats rather annoying is the start menu opening by itself while Im free driving or in a race, other than that its been pretty good and fun!
 No. There have been no know patches. Unfortunately, it appears that this may not see a patch.
 Yes

 No. One player or multiplayer online only.
 No there isnt. Its region free. However, my console abs game are from US
 It\s less like the original hot pursuit from 1998 and more like the hot pursuit from 2010, whichever one it is you\re referring to. While you\re not consistantly selecting tracks to race on, it\s more like having all the tracks combined into one seemingly cohesive environment, which you can either drive to yourself or jump to from your Hideout/Command Post. To be honest, it is what you want it to be; if you like more arcade-style racing where you go race to race, do that. If you want to just drive around until you find something you fancy, you can do that too. The nice thing that makes Rivals so compatable with different player types is that it allows you to make the game what you will. Don\t like free roam? Don\t free roam. Want to drive around challenging other racers head-to-head or messing with cops because you can? You can do that too.
 Its the same game , just has some bonus cars added by online download.Thats the only difference that i saw.
 Do you mean the controller? No it is not controlled by the motion of your hands, and I could not find a setting for it. Controls are easy to use with the analog joystick/moveable pad on the controller yes.

 I dont know the official rating, but I can say from playing that the game has no foul language, nudity, or adult situations. It doesnt have blood either, though it does have cartoon-like violence (your character dies often and generally goes around eating animals). If you get it for a kid you might consider adjusting the settings to make it easier, since it can be pretty hard.
 The multiplayer is in beta right now. You can buy the beta separately to access online now, or wait until its released for free to everyone.
 This is the online code needed to activate the game on Steam.
 Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8
 Yes, it is.

 We havent been told if there is. At some point in the future there should be, but we just dont know when. This is supposed to work with a Mac if you have Windows-emulator software. VMWare Fusion (which I believe can be downloaded online) is supposed to allow you to use Windows products on a Mac computer. You might want to research that.
 According to the Chess King web page; all software is compatible with the Windows systems - XP thru win8. (see Paul Edvalsons comment)
 My console came with an already used PS+ membership but Amazon replaced. Everything else was Good.
 You just have to write the code in the Redeem codes section of Playstation Store.
 Yes
 You can use the figures from any skylanders game that came out before swap force did.
 Yes. The portal platform with USB comes with this set.
 To get from beginning to end in a linear fashion you could do it with just a hand full of figures, but there are side areas and alternate paths that would require a full compliment skylanders to take full advantage of the game.
 Nope. There is a separate set.

 Yes, this will get you there. There are a bunch of videos included with it starting with the absolute basics of holding and stringing the guitar. Most people dont watch many of them, like me, and just can pick it up and go from there. You can get to be pretty decent just by working through the songs. This has more than what you need to get proficient, aka able to play but not like a pro necessarily
 No, you shouldnt have to hold it. Your female connector (spring steel clips) are probably stretched out a little.
 In order to use your guitar with Rocksmith, you do not use an amp at all. You plug the guitar to the computer with the Ubisoft Rocksmith Real Tone Cable.
 The cable is 1/4 male jack at one end and USB at the other end.
 This game actually teaches you the cords so you could pick up other songs and play them after you get good at this game. It won\t really help with Sheet music and music theory as much though.
 Honestly yes it is worth it. You get ALOT more content on the new one and the second one is more of an upgrade to the Rocksmith product rather than just a sequel. Definitely get the new one you wont regret it
 The actual game will only come with an air guitar, this guitar will only exist in your imagination and does not plug into any systems but your mind (advantage is calibration is not required and neither is tuning). For a physical guitar you can either buy the guitar and video game bundle or purchase the game and guitar separately.
 Yes you can just change your settings before playing on multiplayer as long as you have it on the same console and 2 cables you should be good to go
 Its pretty easy to use on the PS3, never tried it on a PC.
 From what I understand two people can plug in and play on the same system. Two cables are required to do so and you cannot play online with someone.
 No you do not have to have Kinect. However if you do it allows you to use voice to navigate the menus. I personally do not use it I just use my controller and is does not affect any of my gameplay experience.
 Yes you can
 Yes, youre asked if you wasnt too play left or right handed. Im left handed and it works perfectly fine
 Only when youre playing it. Once its in tune, based on the quality of your guitar, it should stay tuned. To that key anyway. When I change key in the game it automatically prompts me to tune it and the tuning feature is actually quite helpful. Usually takes less than a minute with my guitar. Hope that helped.
 Yes it can. At least I never installed it. You will need memory to save of course.
 Yes
 Up until now I have had no problems with setting up or transitioning with the less. They stay as bright as you set them constantly.
 This is one of the more customizablly comfortable keyboards that Ive used. There isnt really any noticeable insufficienties with it, but it is a little high for just to play minecraft. I recommend a steelseries Gv mechanical keyboard at the most if youre adamant on a mechanical keyboard.

 Yes, there is plenty of room for both the 3DS XL and the AC adapter! Theres also two slots for games too.

 I had the same question, so I poked around and looked for the actual dimensions of the case and of the New 3DS XL. If Im reading the dimensions right, theres still plenty of room. The New 3DS is slightly bigger than the regular one, but there still should be room.
 I would say this case has 3 sections - the back and the front. The back one is the snug one and fits the 3DS XL perfectly without a strap on it. The front section is exposed a bit more and currently holds my MH4 Card case perfectly. It can also hold the charger, headphones and other items of you choose to have a smaller card care (or dont take one at all). Hope this helps.
 As far as I know it does.
 The kids say its better!
 well... yes. I suppose you have kinect; because you must have to play
 Not work!
 I am sorry but that was bought for my daughters group home and I have never used it. Wish I could help.

 Check your headset controls. Update console AND the headset by going to Turtle Beach website.
 Yes with a blue tooth adapter

 Mine did, factory sealed
 Not sure about PS4, everything needed was included for my XBox 360.
 It is wired into the controller. It does not require batterys and will run off the controllers rechargeable batterys
 the controller currently converts game audio to stereo (NOT surround sound). There may be a patch to fix this in the future, but who knows. There are 2 icons on the left of the adapter...the top is the controller icon that controls the game volume, the bottom is a person icon that controls the chat party volume. If you hold the chat icon for a couple seconds, it will mute the game volume; if you just tap one or the other, you can volume up or down the selected line.
 You can with the second cable provided. You can also use that cable on a computer too. It is just like any normal headphone jack.
 Yes it is
 It should. The headset doesnt plug into the console/TV at all. Its a regular stereo headset, and it comes with an adapter for the Xbox One controller. The only cables plug into the controller, and theres a spare more suited to another device like a phone or laptop.
 Yes. You just have to buy this...
 The headset has a 3.5mm 4-pole plug hardwired to it. It is not designed for use with cordless landline handsets, but will connect to most smartphones and tablets.
 Yes....you can use it with your phone ...or with xbox 360 or xbox one...
 Neil, you would also need an Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter made by Microsoft to use this with an Xbox One. With that adapter it is fully compatible.
 I am use with XBOX 360 and noew we are connected to TV.

) You can hear yourself if you talk loud enough, but that defeats the purpose. This was one huge letdown for me with this headset, as the playback feature on the x12s was perhaps the best feature of the headset.

 The XO FOUR comes with the original Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter made by Microsoft. If you want one of the Turtle Beach adapters, which add features like mic monitoring and Bass Boost and other presets you should look at the XO ONE, XO SEVEN Pro, or the Call of Duty Sentinel Task Force or Call of Duty Sentinel Prestige. Those headsets were all launched after Microsoft decided that headset manufacturers needed to make their own adapters. Up until the summer of 2014 Microsoft mandated that manufacturers use the adapter made by Microsoft.
 Yes
 I am not certain on all games, but a few I have played yes and some no. Thanks
 Yes, if you use it without the inline amp it will work fine
 Yes it will work on a Wii U. Just unplug the headset from the inline amp and plug it directly into the Wii Us 3.5mm audio port. Easy Peasy. The Marvel Seven is a great headset, I actually use one at my desk every day for phone calls and video chat.
 No its not removable.
 Comfort is good you just have to break them in first. They were tight on me out of the box but after a few nights of leaving them extended on a box that wasnt an issue. But comfort is really dependent on your opinion and preference. Sound is very good in my opinion these are better than the more pricey headsets out right now. The mixer is a bit of a pain to use though depending on what platform youll be using these on. I got these for the PC and have to change some settings to get them to work properly. Lately I have been using them on the PS4 except the mixer will not work at all for me. Just the headset itself plugged into the controller works fine though.

 Yes, it has HDMI output.
 As long as youre going to play games of the actual discs, then yes 4 gigabytes is plenty good. If you are wanting to download games from xbox live and run them off a hard drive, then 4 gigs will not get you very far.

There are larger ones now available, and I\d guess other brands are just as good. In fact, my drive had nothing that identified it as a Hausbell drive -the drive looked totally generic. Note that this and other drives advertised and/or labeled as for the Slim, work fine on the 360E because the octagonal slots are identical.
 Yes you lost certainly can but not Blu Ray ones. Only Playstation 3 and 4 does that. And you can do Netflix and Hulu also.
//www.amazon.com/500GB-Hard-Drive-Internal-Black/dp/B00JJIJNB6/ref=pd_cp_pc_3. Mine installed easily and automatically, and works fine. Any hexagonal drive designed for the Xbox will work, and any that are supposed to be for the Slim (like mine) will work perfectly on the 360E.
 It comes with the basic cords. If you like games in HD you gotta buy your own
 This one for sure , better system for the $ the elite made noises and always messed up so get this
 Unfortunately no.
 I havent had the red ring since using this model. It has worked great for me. As to fixing things with this one, I am sure they have updated some things.
 This unit uses a hardrive configuration that goes in a slot. The hard drive is not on the side like the white xbox 360 models. The harddrive for this model is different than the sidemounted ones
 No only for updates but not for playing watching movies listing to music you download from a music
 open-ended
 Yes, you can use a generic hard drive (with case and correct xbox 360 format) or original hard drive, both are on sale in amazon.com
 110 but it goes into transformer. Dont know transformer output.
 No. Sorry I dont do international shipping.
 It should be, I live in Germany and it made it here.
 Sorry, no splitscreen.
 Barely any people play at all now
 No ranked matches are available at this time. However, there are updates made to the game all the time (they just recently added private matches) and I expect that to be a gamerype added at a future time.
 This game does not offer co-op of any kind. You can only play on Xbox Live together from different consoles.
 It has three save slots, autosave and you can save to the slots anytime you want.
 No, its just a remake of Fable 1.
 Yes
 The original Fable was not hands free, so this game is not either. That would be cool though!
 Nope

 Scott is wrong you can charge this with a wall charger as long as the wall charger puts out enough amps, i.e. my iPad charger allows me to charge it but the smaller iPhone does not. hope this helps. I know you posted this a while ago and you probably already know the answer.
//support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controller-pc-compatibility If you cant get it to work try the drivers from the link.
 Definitely around that amount. I usually charge around once a week and it charges in about 1 to 2 hours.
 No warranty. But check to make sure it isnt the weather or anything bothering the current of electricity
 Here is what u can do.u can get the last of us bundle 500gb witch is 270$.and yes u can play other games with the last of us bundle.
 I ship from Tucson, Arizona
 Probably not. Refer to Amazons customer service department for more detailed information on shipping and payment method.
 No defect that I know of. Since buying this system it has been a champ!
 Yes. The PS3 plays PS3 Blu-Ray games, DVDs, PS1 Games, Blu-Ray movies, and CDs.
 5 V. 5, yes. MyGM, no. MyCareer, yes but it takes longer to level up your player without VC.
 Yes, you can
 The dunk contest and three point shootout are in the myCareer and myGM modes. In myCareer you can only do the shootout because of some weird glitch. Not sure about myGM.
 no but you can on 2k15
 yes it can be if you choose. very fun game for kids, men and even family time for father and son. hope you enjoy it

 No. Is only for Wii U
 the old Wii controllers work as well as the standard one that comes with the Wii U. I prefer the Wii U wireless controllers they made for the system
 I never played Mario Galaxy. Mario 3D World has a multiplayer where the players who fall behind will automatically be put in a bubble to catch up with the player or players in the lead. I play with my nieces (3-5 yrs) all the time. They dont even notice the bubble bringing them along. Great family game.
 Some areas of the game require the gamepad. When you encounter those areas, the game will tell you how to switch controllers.
 You can play the campaign with up to four players

 Like others have said, its subjective. The music that people use to deter others from playing only appear in the early stages of the game and only once, yet they continue to ignorantly dismiss the rest of the soundtrack and thus the entire game itself in some sort of backwards thinking. The music is remixed like the usual fashion of Mario World and the original Yoshis Island, its very cheery, calming, or exciting depending on the level. The only way to know for sure how the music is, is to play the games itself because the music is all made to accompany the levels and they flow quite nicely together.
 Yes

 Yoshi has to rescue a kidnapped baby luigi while protecting baby Mario so the brothers can be reunited.

 This game is for the Wii U, so it wont work on an older system. You can play Wii games on the Wii U however.
 Both games are a bit challenging. I havent completed Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze to assess the whole game, but I dont think Returns is any harder. If you thought the previous one was too difficult, you might not like this one either. I would recommend Super Mario 3D World as it is easier but a lot of fun.
 If you buy it new it comes with a new club Nintendo code. If you buy it used there is a chance it will be missing.
 I have a 4 & 8 years old who love the same games and they love this game!! We play together and we teach them to never give up!!!!

 It varies by mini game. There are some that pit game pad player vs the others with remotes who use the television to play. There are others that dont use the game pad at all, if I recall correctly, and some that use the game pad flat on its back like an old school two player Pac-Man game. The game comes with a small collapsible stand that will hold the pad flat. Lots of variety to the way the mini games use the Wii U.
 No, you must have a Wii U to play this game.
 It came with a remote. No stand.
 I think you have to have at least two players. I know they will have NPCs to fill in for the rest.....the game is most certainly meant for kids...I play it with my kid sometimes just as a bonding thing....my kid just checked and she says you must have 2 players
 No, this is no Wii Sports wich you can buy online at the eShop

 It only works on Wii U. You can use Wii games on Wii U console, but you cannot use Wii U games on a Wii console. I hope this helps!
 Its quite different. Some events are the same as they are olympic events but there are far more different events than there are same ones.
 no you will have to get the wii U remote with sensor
 Yes, it can be played with more than 2 people also in some games.
 My son - who owns/uses the game - says no, the board will not work because it does not have the Motion Plus built into it.
 It only works on Wii U. You can use Wii games on Wii U console, but you cannot use Wii U games on a Wii console. I hope this helps!
 Its quite different. Some events are the same as they are olympic events but there are far more different events than there are same ones.

 Usually you get pre-order games the day they are released. Except for Nintendo games, Im on Amazon Prime and every Nintendo game in the last 2 years or so that I have pre-ordered have been shipped out the day or day after their release date (some were released on Sunday so they were shipped out on Monday).
59 p.m. PT) on Club Nintendo and youll receive a free download code for the digital version of one of four free games.
 Amazon doesnt directly sell any Wii U consoles. Its all third party sellers. The bundle may show up at some point, but it wont be direct from Amazon in all likelihood.
 Unless you own an American Wii U it wont matter where Amazon.com ship. The console is region locked, so if you live in places like Europe, Australia or any PAL region, you wont be able to play this edition and will have to buy from a store stocking PAL games.
 Regular Wii remote will work fine.

 You shoot pixel soldiers and robots with pixel guns until they fall over or blow up. When you sneak behind an enemy you can snap his or her neck. Its a shooter so of course there will be blood and violence, but its nothing thatll traumatize him. As for language, he probably hears worse things during recess at school.
 You need one of the internal Xbox 360 hard drives. Get the official Xbox branded drives from Microsoft themselves. The 3rd party HDDS are lower quality and can get your console banned. USB devices will NOT work, not even external USB hard drives.
 There is no split screen option, so you can only play one at a time. The profile for your play is linked to your xbox live profile, so as long as you and your father are ok with sharing an xbox live gold account, and stats, you only need one gold account. Please be aware that this game can only be played online with xbox live. There is no offline play available.
 I dont think you can turn off the blood. But yes, you can turn off the voices.
 No, there isnt a game code. A used copy should be fine.
 lol
 just purchase the game then your set, you dont pay for multiplayer
 The best setup is with a keyboard and mouse. Mice give much greater accuracy when compared to controllers. Although you can play with a controller you might be at a disadvantage though.
 Honestly, I am not sure. But some period they gave us special offer for free seasonal passes and maps. I think you dont have to pay an additional membership for playing.
 nope. Hard copy
 you dont need ps plus to play online you just have to pay the monthly subscription.
 1) You can purchase a PS4 copy of the game and register that copy to your existing Square Enix account (the same one you use from PS3). This would then allow you to log into the game from either system, your PS3 or PS4. As this involves another purchase of the game, you would also receive another 30 days of subscription time free (which is their way of saying included with the purchase price) or 2) You can transfer your existing PS3 service to PS4. To do this, log into your Square Enix account at the MogStation, select Playstation4 Upgrade, and follow the prompts. This transfer is free of charge (until the end of 2014), but once the transfer is complete, you would no longer be able to log in to the game from your PS3. (And since there\s no additional purchase with this option, there\s no additional 30 days, either.)
 No
 Yep, and with the PS3 version too! Just make sure you\re on the same server (known as Worlds).
 i believe its 15 a month
 Yes 2 players can play at the same time.
 characters are usable on any system, just depends on the game, newer games support all while older games support up to the games release.
 I believe so, yes. This is my first purchase, but my nephew has the trap team and those characters do not work with this.
 These are the starter pack characters. Im not aware of any choices. Theyre included in the box.
 Sure does, thats one of its major features. I play it with my child often.
 The portal and disc will not work on the xbox360, the figures will work across platforms. I have both 360 and the Xbox one and interchange the figures regularly.
 The game disk is also included
 It is wired. If it wasnt you would go through a lot of batteries. Trust me we have the ds version.
 Im not sure about the portal, but I know the figures work with each game.
 Menus are in English, yes. Songs arent.

 Ashes to ashes is his only single the rest are all in a group singing
 When I bought the Killzone Bundle the PS+ came in the box.
 No it doesnt.
 Yes, as I mentioned it comes with all accessories. Are you planing to purchase this console?
 Subscription excellent PS4 has always innovated and renew each year, ps4 for me is the ultimate and Playstation plus.
 The ps plus membership was sent by e-mail not a card in the box.
 Sure, just remember u need high speed Internet for updates.
 500
 Yes it does. I am from Australia so I just plug my power cord from my PS3, a standard figure 8 lead in and it works perfect.
 yes, we do ship to Canada
 One year
 actually I received this but no and it did have the blue ring of death but Amazon work with me and resent me a new unit ASAP with no other complaints I love my ps4
 you can search on Amazon for used item and you should be able to find it
 Yes
 One years worth of online time
 nope
 I dont know. I just have used it on my PS3 and my laptop. I can tell you that it works pretty good!
 Im not sure, I have only used it with PS3 games.
 It connects via USB, so as long as you have a USB port on your laptop, yes, it will work.
 works good for me on midtown madness. I use auto transmission and park brake on one of the paddle/levers. I am 50 years old and this is my 2nd wheel--broke the paddles on the first one (it was a Saitek?) this one is very good for the price but I am not a gamer. just use it for midtown madness and it works great. the accelerator pedal is a little upright (too tall). I only use accelerator hand brake/park brake and one of the toggle buttons for screen changes. there are other buttons but my game is 12 years old and has no use for them. I like the suction cups and do not use the clamps because they hit my knees under the slide out table (keyboard slider board under the desk) that i set the unit on. I bought for the price and was expecting crap but am very happy with it.
 Im using an Xbox 360 controller and it works perfectly, no hassle. Just plug in and thats it.
 I downloaded it through Steam and it works just fine with Windows 8.1.
 Yes. U will get code for activation on STEAM. Just give someone this code.
 Yes you can play the game offline, if you have 2 usb ports you can plug in 2 controllers and play against your friends as well &#128522;
 Happened with me too but I found a game Neverwinter thats free and have been playing for months now.

 You can download it right now, but wont be able to play it until the 25th.
 I dont see why not, all you need to do is check the specs of your surface pro and check the pc requirements of DS2. You may not be able to completely max it out, but it should run just fine
 People have reported that the game is playable on low settings with Intel HD 4000 chipset at 20-30 fps. I could not play Dark Souls 2 at 20 fps but others may be happy with that. Be aware that when pushing older hardware to its max you may get other issues like crashes, stutters, artifacts, or over heating.
 If its a usb controller, yes.
 Its basically the black armor edition only you dont get the exclusive metal case its all digital.

 sadly i dont think there is one. you need to use the cd that comes with the package
 It works on my computer with Win8.1
 Pretty much anything that is not locked to a specific game type
 Variable rate
 This is the physical version of the game.
 No.
 Nop
 The box says 49gb minimum.
 I believe so yes, I played around with the controls once and I think there was a lefty option.
 It comes with instructions on how to program - no software necessary as far as I know - looks like a series of keystrokes. Love this keyboard so far. Only complaint I have is that it didnt tilt up enough for me.
 The FN button next to the right alt key, push and hold that and then press the escape key while holding the FN key.
 19.13
 I have the same issue, then I just unplug the cable.
 People need to stop answering questions that they have no idea the answer to. This keyboard is not mechanical. Most mechanical keyboards retail for over $80 minimum. This keyboard is a digital nub sensor.
 YES YOU PUT IT AT ANY ANGLE YOU WISH.
 No
//forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=37064 Thanks, Lucy
 No, I dont see how it could
 Wheel stand Pro can certainly support the Rhino, if you can get the platforms to interface (sit the controllers on) to the wheel stand.
 Regular wii remote is inserted in belt.
 Yes
 This game works on the wii u an long as you have all the pieces that go with the wii u there is nothing additional needed to run the game
 Yes it does!
 Im not sure bc Ive never played world party on regular wii...the graphics on wii u are amazing
 Its about 8-10 feet.
 Not sure if you can use for ps4 its not wireless
 Unfortunately, no. As far as controllers go, it has no advantages over the original PS3 other than comfort but even that is dashed because the tiny shoulder buttons sometimes pinch fingers.
 This is for the original Wii. The Wii version will work on the Wii U, but not vice versa.
 Yes, the belt is necessary BUT it already comes included with the game. I found this out after I purchased an additional belt. I love this zumba though! Have fun!
 Yes, the belt is included.
 Yes, I have lost over 40lbs in 5 months doing the elliptical for about 50 minutes in the morning and doing a full hour of Zumba in the evening anywhere between 4-7 days a week. I was more consistentl with Zumba precisely because it was so much fun while getting a great calorie burn. Dont be too concerned about staying on beat, my motto was as long as I was moving I was burning and I lost going from a size 14-16 to down to a size 6-8 in only 5 months!
 It didnt, I already had one.
 It doesnt but the keys are very responsive with the price considered.
 The keys light up. The letters also light up blue as well as under the keys. Its a pretty good mouse and keyboard I like mine.
 You can turn on and off the LED back light on the keyboard using the scroll lock button. The mouse is permanently lit; no on and off button. Im not sure about the warranty.
 Not that Im aware of, but in my case its the individual characters that dont respond.
D
 My daughter said the quality is FANTASTIC. I talk outside the room they are playing their games and the person on the other end can hear me clear as a bell. She said you can hear everything. They are well made. They are definately worth the price. There were 2 in the package and I bought 2. I gave them 1 and I have 3 put away. My kids were going through 1 headset every 2 Months. Maybe more. Un like the cheap ones you get with XBOX, which have only one side for hearing and they were cheap with the band around the head, these are like stereo headphones with both ears with cushions (real cushions not that cheap black stuff) and a Mic that has metal around the bendable stick part. All in all,this was a great find as far as I am concerned, and I am very happy that I purchAsed them. Im sure you will be happy too !!
 No it doesnt. Its part of the plug assembly.
 It has a volume conto on the cord. Slider wheel.
 Yes
 Yess it plugs in thee controller
 One short. One long
 It does it hooks up to the xbox controller and the computer so you can hear the game and chat.
 no actually Ive been trying to get in touch with you guys because the mic does not work what can I do about that
 Go to Accessory Settings in the settings tab in the main dashboard. Choose the Audio Device Settings option. Change the Input Device to the dream gear option and the output device should automatically change to the input device.
 Its alright I wouldnt get it again for its price.
 Dragon Ball Z Attack of the Saiyans for the Nintendo DS.
 English.
 There is no Dub in Spanish. It only has subtitles in spanish.
 No it doesnt
 No. The Xbox one is not backwards compatible
 Nope, sorry. He isnt.
 This game doesnt have couch co-op or local co-op. Co-op is only available on Xbox live
 Yes
 No. Though you can probably make them work if you really want to, you would essentially need to set up your controller to control a mouse pointer. These are all RTS strategy games (with the exception of Renegade). I can\t even imagine any situation where a controller would be preferable to a mouse with an RTS strategy game. They were never designed with that controller in mind.
 EA Origin account required
 I dont know but, found this info from KrittMasta, No, this is strictly working on Windows. Unless you run Windows emulator (Vine) or something on Mac, you cant play this game. Youll need a mouse to play. It would be very effective if you have a fullsize keyboard with it. Other than that, sorry.
 They do work on windows 8, matter of fact, thats what I play them on.

 3 separate codes.
 No, just the main games. I picked up the infinite season pass on sale for $10 right after I bought the triple pack. That was a few months back though.
 There are three keys.
 Now, Im not 100% sure, but I believe it will give you the option for pc or windows download
 I assume that as long as you have Steam and Windows, it should work.
 5.1 for the 2013 edition. Sounds really really great
 No thats going to cost you more but if if you do want to get everything you can buy bundle with the mixamp and headset
 No
 They are decent but you will not get surround sound audio.
 I havent really heard my own voice through the mic, but from what Ive heard from my friends, it sounds really clear.

 Honestly No it isnt my younger brother is better then me at it and he didnt find it any help ful, so no it isnt at all. And its tooo expensive
 Yes it those drop shot jump SHOT exc
 Hi! You can use any pc available controller. I for one, use the 360 controller sometimes but my brother uses his ps3 controller and it works nice with both.
 Yes
 Hi! It does. It runs almost with any recent processor with integrate graphics. From 2013 to date, any processor can handle FF VII graphics requirements. I had a core i7 from 2012 and no graphics card. The game runs perfectly! Hope you enjoy!
 You will download the steam client then follow the steps emailed to you
 Its a digit game code for Steam to download the entire game.

 No
 U can play with the CD borrowed from your friend on your PS4. But if U are not going to use the CD/return the CD, Then U still have to download the game.U cannot install the game on your PS4 from a borrowed CD.
P (i deleted it)
 Yes it does supports trophies, since each Game comes in different disc, so is like having each Game separately.
 No
 Yes
 Yes it is, just download uplay and enter the key and boom youre in!
 It does not work for Stream, only uPlau. You will have to create an uPlay account if you dont currently have one.
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable
 Yes,not problem
 the whole game is playable with 2 people. Im not sure about 3+. but its super fun with 2!
 The PS4 digital code allows you to download the game directly to your system.
 open-ended
 Yes. You are able to play with two characters and a third in tow, allowing one of you to switch to that third character depending on the task to be completed.
 Yes. My kids love this game.

 Although I have no knowledge of those boxes I do know if they have micro usb audio output or bluetooth audio then it should work. If no micro usb audio out then perhaps an adaptor to go from phone jack to that? Youd have to check with a place like RadioShack to help you for such things. Also theres such a thing as phone jack to bluetooth transmitters. Hope that helps.
 Yes...
 I have worn mine in the rainrain with no ill affect
 Musicjogger just can listen to music with bleutooth device, not included with TF/Micro card, and sorry that aslo can not listen to radio station itself unless by your mobile phone
 I believe as long as you have Bluetooth in the Kindle it should work, then again I only used on Apple products.
 Yes
 It fits both.
 No you can not.
 Honestly I dont know. Ive never put a regular sized one in. Sold mine forever ago. But Id assume that it would be fine. From my memory the older 3DS, while smaller, was a tad thicker. And since this case has a strap on the inside that should hold it in place. And even then, if it did start moving around you could always try using one of those protective hard shell casings. Hope this helps.
 Yes, thats what I got it for and it is a perfect fit.
 I would think so. But I wouldnt know for sure, I only have an XL 3DS. But I dont see why it wouldnt be able to.
 It fits the 3DS XL, so it should fit the DSi XL
 Nope, just storage.
 A regular 3DS will, in fact, fit in this case. While it is designed with the XL in mind, it holds pretty firm so you shouldnt have to worry about too much sliding around. There are smaller cases for the standard size 3DS too.

 I am assuming you are talking about the puzzel code that pops up through out the game. Once you solve one of these it usually gives you access to Cameras which allows you to hack certain areas. Some of these codes are relatively easy and some are not (they get tougher as you progress through the game). I was lucky enough to score one of the Limited Edition Hardback guides (almost 3 thick) and it goes into great detail on each of the individual codes and shows you exactly how to complete them. Without this guide I would have been completely lost. This is one of the most intense games that I have ever owned and takes a great deal of patience to play but very satisfying at at the end. I hope my comments help.
 you cant afford ps plus?
 Similar but just as good.
 The thing with this game is that, as an open world game, you pretty much dictate what to do. If you follow the story you will be given specific missions and cutscenes are expected, but if you dont you can pretty much create the mayhem you want and be chased by the police. Besides it, there is a mode to use a giant mechanical spider...pretty cool. It is not by any means an alternative to GTA or Saints Row as it is not as polished and structured as those ones. but its pretty fun.
 Yup!
 Yes it does make a slight clicking noise with all buttons. Its somewhat quieter than most and definitly quieter than just about every keyboard I have owned but you will eventually not even hear it all after a short while. The buttons have a nice feedback feel to them and if you have small hands such as I because I am a shorter person than average the mouse will feel a little big to you but all in all I like it.
 No sorry
 The dpi is set to a specific color by default. You change te default colors and dpi by pressing the dpi button on the mouse. You can customize the colors by using the software that is included.
 You can change the colors via software as you like.
 Yes
 Yeah. It comes with a SD Card, charger and a stylus.
 You can.
 I dont think so. Its discounted and the pictures dont show the second analog stick on the right. I guess Amazon isnt selling it before it launches on the 13th.
 That depends. If you bought them from a normal local vendor (one based in the US), they will almost surely be from that region. However, if you buy them from a pawn shop or from a person, it is possible they wont be. This has never been an issue for me since the dawn of video games. I do suggest that you simply be careful when purchasing games on websites that are completely in another language as it is very likely the games will be from another region. My brother made that mistake and assumed the game would work on his English version console. Considering that the game was only released in Japan though, it should have been obvious.
 why would you even ask this? it\s a retro version of an old school game gear. not everything needs facebook or wifi lol
 No, if u want multi system emulation get the JXD-S5110b. Just type it into Amazon and youll see the PS4 clone that emulates multiple systems from the 8 and 16 bit eras, I think it does N64 also
 No
 read the reviews.
 This was a gift but I think the games were built into system
 I forgot to tell you that I was using a splitter on mine. The head set plugs into the controller for power no batteries for the head set. But the part that plugs into the controller has a 3.5 plug on. Because you can unplug the head set and plug it straight into your iPhone and it works. There is also another cord Polk sent me for free that is for use with a phone and it has a built in mic... Hope this helped a little.
 I believe it will Ive watched movies and Netflix with them the only problem is the controller shuts off if you dont move the joystick or press a button every 5 min or so and if that happens you will not have sound.
 Actually they will call you and confirm you received the boom mic
 My worked just fine but it was horrible having a cheap add on mic to a beautifully made headset with pop up mic which didnt work, so I dont want to use it any more... I have since spent 200 more to have a headset work as intended (Sennheiser G4ME ONE)
 I never got anything. I think theyve stopped caring. It would help if they showed what it looked like. I even called them, spoke with someone who said Id get an email with tracking but I never got anything.
 It should. I have one and I connect it via optical audio.
 There are no issues I have a PS4, and it works great with it.
//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response
 No
 It has feet at the bottom to allow it to sot on a table, but it does have portrait slots on each side to allow it hang from the wall like a picture
 Yes. There is a micro SD card port in the back that supports up to 32 Gb. 64 GB microSD comes with exFAT format that is not supported on any android system. If you want to use 64Gb, you need to format the 64 GB microSD card to FAT32 using your PC or Mac computer.
 I bought this expecting not to use it much i just like hand held games , I got it to stream from my pc which works very well , however i didnt expect to be playing android games on it , but i find myself playing them all the time . I also use it as a emulator through android apps so now i have access to all the games for older systems such as n64, nintendo, psp, playstation, sega ,just about anything you can find an emulator for also i can hook up the xbox 360 wireless dongle and hook it up to the tv and play multiplayer games like twisted metal, or i can just play my computer games on the big screen in the living room it all works very well, they keep it up to date and are adding alot more features like pc streaming outside of youre home network. I would never hesitate to buy another one and ill buy any newer versions they come out with. there is also a nvidia grid feature that they are testing which allows you to stream games from nvidias server and it works great with my internet connection and is free to do right now they have several good titles, this is by far the best quality hand held you will find i didnt think the controller would be very comfortable because it looked weird in the pictures but it is a very comfortable controller . needless to say I love my shield and would recommend it to anyone.
 Zombies and Virtual Tennis. All of them are totally controled by Nvidia Shield...
 It has been 1 year since your question, but I felt it necessary to post that Scott Beeson, the previous poster to answer your question, is wrong. The NVIDIA Shield is designed to do exactly what you described.
 Yes, its still worth it, its still I awesome piece of hardware. I personally dont really use the game streaming feature a lot, but I love the attention it gets me in public. People are always like wow what are you playing on.

 Only the first generation PS3 consoles can play PS2 games.
 I do not know the space requirements for that game, but you can look at the back of the game case or google your question. Either way you will use up that 12gb really fast with system updates, game updates, and save files so i would still invest in a internal hard drive. Not an external hard drive as you cannot play your games off of the external.
 The PS unit does, but to buy an individual controller at a store or online, no.
 Persona 4 Arena. In short no it will not play Pal encoded Blu Rays nor display them correctly.
 On all the ps3s there are only 2 USB ports, but you can plug in a 4 port USB hub and have all 4-5 controllers working. Actually the ps3 supports up to 8 players but good luck finding a game that will support 8 lol Wireless is up to 8 controllers also, you can of course combine wire and wireless.
 The key is a headphone wrap and the fish is a cord wrap.
 You would use your iphone 5 usb cable
 Yes.. works with anything that has a USB cord.

 Yes.. works with anything that has a USB cord.
 I havent charched a tablet with the Lepow series 3000mAh. It perfectly works with my cell phone.
 it takes a couple hours only
 Yes, A very good manal.
 No, its a unique receiver thats not compatible with other Logitech products. The K750 uses the Logitech unifying receiver which is compatible with a range of Logitech products that supports unifying, but there are no Logitech gaming mice that support unifying receivers currently. Net, youll need to use both receivers with that keyboard and mouse combination.
 Yes they are very easy to push down and all buttons can be pushed pushed from just about any angle this also includes the thumb buttons. Up down left right but thumbs requires more push as it would interfere with pressing them if it were any easier you would get miss presss.
 Nope. I have a glass desk and bought this and still have to use a mouse pad. Its a great mouse and I still like it, but it does not work on glass.
 The scroll will is click stop but very smooth , new experience from logitech. You cant control it like the MX
 yes
 Yes you can.
 Yes
 Yes it is amazing for every game easy to use
 Yes
 As long you use a computer with a USB port, and mouse compatable then yes.
 It sounds normal like any other mouse clicks and you will get a wired mouse no doubt. It works very well.
 This works perfectly windows 8
 No,there arent,this mouse is plug and play
 You can get it in both. Just double check which one your ordering.
 There is a very brief scene in the game where you see a woman button her shirt and a man zip up his pants in an attempt to imply that she was trading sexual favors for medical supplies. There is no nudity.
 thives in time) but this game and PLaystation all stars are amazing on the vita.
 Its not that bad of a game i mean its not like he is asking for dead space on a playstation 3. However you are doing a great job at parenting seeking help first before buying him a game. I think it is rated mature. I would say let him play it 12-16yr olds i think should handle it just as well as a 17yr old. Ive played mature games since i was a young kid and theres nothing wrong with zombie games for a 12 yr old. If youre a really cautious parent though then no he would need to wait a few more yesrs
 Yes
 I think there are a max of 4 score keeping slots at any one time, I have done it with 3 kids at once. But if you have enough room to move about it is the movement that is fun not the score keeping, So if they like dance it is fun to move along with out keeping score, and it is a work out, so taking turns or in other words resting, is certainly an option and there are enough slots to keep track of everyone\s score.
 Yes, it plays in the Wii mini.
)
 zumba kids states it is for use only in the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Latin America. I did not see any marking to indicate it is a multi 5. I hope that helps.
 No, you need to play it on Nintendo Wii with controller. The game checks to see how much the controller movement matches up with the movement on the screen to award points.
 No. Not at all.
//www.bethblog.com/2013/08/07/the-complete-elder-scrolls-collection-comes-to-pc-this-september/ For Oblivion, this means that the **disc** version of the game does not include the smaller add-ons (Horse Armor, Fighter\s Stronghold, Mehrunes\ Razor, etc)... more on that below. As a bonus, the included Steam key will activate Steam versions of Morrowind GOTY and Oblivion GOTY Deluxe. Like the disc release of Oblivion, the deluxe versions include the main game, Knights of the Nine, and Shivering Isles, but it also adds English versions of the Wizard\s Tower, Fighter\s Stronghold, Orrery, Thives\ Den, The Vile Lair, Mehrunes\ Razor, and Horse Armor. These add-ons are not compatible with the disc version of the game, so you will need to use the Steam version to access them.
 You only need to download steam for skyrim i believe and once its downloaded it should ask for skyrims activation code
 Hey Ashlan you can still play your game it downloads everything and will continue with your game. You will not lose anything. I hope that helps.
 Sadly no. Its a PC only.
 Sadly, no. You can find digital copies in .pdf format at manuals.bethsoft.com, however.
 Ive had these charging stations on the PS3, and according to Energizer when the controls are already charged, the LED lights are on, but stop charging the batteries. And it really works, because I had four controls, and they worked perfectly until sells them.
 Yes. I live in North America and the charger works fine.
 Yes, it does.
 Yes
 The lights are off when there is no controller attached
 If you purchase Infinity for Wii and decide that you want to move to an XBox360, you will have to buy Infinity for XBox360 but you WILL NOT have to repurchase your characters.
 The figurines are sold alone. The packs are sold with two characters and two power discs. The play sets are sold with two characters and their own world to play in.
 Yes, as I live in Australia. I have brought the item and it works here.

 No it does not play on the original Wii. To play Infinity 2.0 characters you need to change to a X Box 1 or a Playstation 4 or the Wii universe (or whatever the latest model is called).

 The ESRB rating is E for everyon 10+, however this is a family friendly game. If you 6 year old watched the movie I dont see any problems with them playing this. As with all of the Lego games you have to smash objects and enemies, but it isnt a violent game. If you have any concerns download the free demo and play for a few. Great game if you are a fan of the film.
 It comes with a case with the disc in it.
 Yes there is you must complete the game first to unlock it.
 Yes, you can earn all the characters from the movie. Similar to how you earn characters in other Lego games.
 Ahsen you unlock characters as you play an complete missions! Also money collected can unlock characters.

 Anything. It also can be mounted on a bike or on the dash of a car.
 Yes
 Yes it is. The game alone cost about $50.this set also includes a tactical recorder. To capture all your online or off line play. It usually sells by itself for about $70-$100. So its a great bargain to get the game, expansion maps, recorder and a few more bonuses. Good buy. U recommend it.
 The 6000 is capable of 2 full plus a half charges for my phone. It seems that 2500 is needed for for a full charge so figure that the 9000 is good for 3 charges and change. Choosing between the 6000 or the 9000 depends on how many times you need to charge for a given time away from an outlet. Also size and weight is something to consider.
 It will start as soon as you plug it in.
 3.7 x 1.8 x 1 inches
 My Galaxy S3 charge about 1 and a half times
 You can use the same charger you use for your phone or tab. You could also use the computer usb port but it takes much longer. If you want rapid charging you could also buy a rapid charger.
 You will need a larger Hard Drive. The game is quite large and if you intend to play online, you will need more space for the online content, patches, and map packs. I would suggest that you upgrade your hard drive and move your data to the new drive and work from there.
 If you are referring to the harddrive on the Xbox or the an extra external drive you may purchased than yes. Thats how you save your game progress
 Battlefield 4, although BF3 &gt; BF4 Destiny seems pretty good but it couldnt get me hooked like BF4 did.
 You need a HDMI cable thst plugs from your 360 to your flat screen tv if It keeps on saying that then you need to just turn your xbox360 off and then back on or just restart the whole console if you need any other help please feel free to email me at allyboy94@yahoo.com
 Campaign is single player mode playing set missions against the computer. You can get online and play a campaign with other people on your team as well. Most people get online and play multi-player matches where everyone is a real person on both teams.
 I am not 100% positive, but I am pretty sure it will work on any PS3 console.
 As far as I know mulit language support for Battlefield 4 includes English, Spanish, French and Brazilian Portuguese... So yes it includes Spanish hope that helps you out.
 When I first purchased my ps3 version, it had a $10 coupon for the ps4 version but there was no automatic upgrades and another purchase was required.
 Yes it does but Im not sure when it expires
 It is 5 inches from the microphone extension outlet. In reality, it is about 4 1/2 inches (or less) depending on how you bend or shape it. That is not really long enough and I have volume issues since purchasing these to the point where Id just be better off with a secondary mic.
 Its standard 3.5mm connections. Shouldnt be a problem (no drivers)
 They are stitched on, so not sure that you can change them, but might be able to get covers over them.
 It works fine w/o internet. When its connected to the internet, it simply gives you access to your profiles / settings that you have saved in their cloud. If you dont have access to the internet, it will just use the local copy of the settings you have. Its nice because if you go to someone elses house or use a different computer, youll have your custom settings right there for you.
 I wouldnt say better...just different. Ive used both now and the G13 has an awkward analog stick instead of the D-Pad. Theyre entirely two different devices as far as Im concerned. Try them both and decide for yourself.
 Yes I am currently running it on Windows 8.1
 I\m 6\4 (1.93 m) with fairly large hands and it fits great.
 Yes and absolutely yes. this keypad barely has enough buttons for the whole alphabet, let alone an entire keyboard. By no means trash a keyboard for this, its purely meant for a more ergonomic input method. As for the wired/wireless, there are tradeoffs. Personally wired is more reliable, no battery to worry about and no wonky connection issues to deal with. But if you cant configure it to be somewhere comfortable for you within the reach of the wire, thats what wireless is for. Be advised that any wireless device will have at least a tiny bit of lagged input to the computer, so its not advised for anything competitive.
 This headset can connect to an Xbox One controller through the (optional purchase) Stereo Headset Adapter from Microsoft.
 You need the TV volume. This is a chat headset.
 It plugs into controller .
 Yes. The mic is reversible and will go either direction.
 You need to enable it within settings under devices I believe. Look through PS4 settings menu. You may need to reboot PS4 afterwards too. Set it to output to headset.
 I would check the PS4 settings for chat volume. The headset has chat control on the right side of the headphone. Hope that helps
 open-ended
 NO
 Yes. It has a feature to automatically adjust chat volume according to the sound signal, ie whats going on in the game. So if youre in a loud cinematic in game moment, the chat will also j crease in volume. I turn the sound down most of the time unless Im gaming alone. I personally I dont like the feature because it sounds like people are uelling in your ear when the music gets loud
 You are able to get dolby digital audio through the spidif, if you use the bluetooth as comunication device on your computer you will be able to use speaker and microphone on your headsets as mean of comunication. The spidif it self does not support the microphone audio to be send. I have been using the blutooth for skype calls and online gaming and it works. Hope this helps.
 Pull on the middle of the cord, not on the base attached to the headset.
 Yes the headset is compatible with PS3 as well as ps4...awesome headset. I purchased the headset when the ps4 first came out on day 1 and a year and half later its still running like a champ.
 I would assume so. It has an audiojack cord, and Ive used it in a pinch for my ipod and pc. I dont own a vita, so I dont know what size jack it has.
 Yes you can. You will need to sync the headphones to the laptop. It will work as long as your laptop has blue tooth capabilities. You can find out by going to the master volume control on the laptops control panel. Hope this helps.
 Yes, it comes with everything and is packaged like it was new.
 So, I deleted my earlier post. Getting 2 audio sources to play simultaneously is actually pretty easy. The mixamp has a line in for spdif (optical) and your typical aux 3.5mm jack. I hooked my computer via spdif and my TV via aux. Youll get both AND be able to toggle the balance with the right earcup game/VoIP switch. (I initially thought it didnt work, as I was 100% to my computer source, hence my deleted answer. Dont make my mistake). I would recommend the spdif from your console and aux from your computer, youll get better in game sound. The balance feature is really nice, and it is tailored to your exact needs.
 Yes
 Yes all ASTRO products will work with the next generation PS4. It uses the same technology that the PS3 used so there are no additional products you need. Sony will be releasing a firmware update though after release that will be required for the chat to work. No details have yet been released about this update. Regards, ASTRO Gaming
 I had problems with my mic on Windows 7. Works fine on Windows 8. There could be a ton of reasons though. You need it set as default in your sound setting and typically selected in the program you are using too. Also, if the mic boom is straight up, it turns the mic off.
 All dlc for origins, base game only for da2. Note that to properly authorize dlc for origins, latest patch must be downloaded.
 Yup... Works on Windows 8.

 They are just Green . Chroma version has unlimited colors!
 The only difference between the backlit and the standard is well backlit! And the difference between the stelth and the greens are the stealth isint clicky
 Yes, on the right hand side of keyboard there are a USB port, a headphone jack and a microphone jack.
 I dont know if these are the latest versions, but these only have one color, which is green. If you want the ones that do change color, youre probably looking for the Chroma Blackwidows.
 No, you cannot. You can play split screen with others on Xbox Live, but not with the person sitting next to you on your own couch. How annoying is that?!
 No
 The developers dont tell the players
 I think acess too certain games in xbox one requires the same gold membership extra money per player as 360. play station does not require additional payment no matter what version and all games like Minecraft and plants vs zombies are ps just like xbox. only xbox seems to want to charge extra
 it is a monthly membership. if you dont have it - you cannot play the game... AT ALL! would have been nice to know that before we bought it.

 Each family members need to have Xbox Gold in order to play online. Since you have it, only you can play XBL. Also make sure the Xbox Gold time in your account is not expired.
 No
 Yes you do need 2 Xbox live accounts to do split screen
 With the physical disk you can re-sale/trade-in. With the digital download you cant.
 Its actually quite fun regardless of age. I would even bet most of the players are older! I wouldnt judge it based in its wonky and cartoonish presentation. Its rather very competitive, deep, and balanced, and a lot of fun actually. I found me and my friends got hooked on it for months. IMO its the best xbox one game to date. Looks great, plays great and it fun what more could you want Its has a third person view, also a zombie or plant master mode where you kind of micromanage as well. Has character cards to unlock abilities and customization for classes. A survival wave mode, team death match, and a domination style mode. All of them are very fun. Every class requires a certain strategy to succeed. I recommend the game to anyone honestly. Its out for Microsoft consoles but will be out on pc and ps3 and ps4 soon I believe
 Correct. Its a online only play game.
 I\m not sure if it\s technically possible (no way to test it since I\m linked up), but even if you can, you won\t be able to play it well, and it\s not a significant enough part of the game to justify a purchase. The co-op part of the game is balanced around planting assistant plants that are only available through card packs that you acquire online (either by earning coins in-game or buying them for cash) through the EA servers. No connection, no packs, no helpers, no way to win.
 Nope- and currently your stats do not transfer
 Sadly, its only 2 player local only splitscreen. And you can only use one profile at a time, so the 2 player is limited to player 1s progress. Kinda lame.
 Same style of attachment except better if that helps. Ive had both.
 Yes
 The people having problems didnt take the time to update to the newest and correct firmware. Even the one I ordered had issues when I first tried it. After the update and applying the correct in game settings, everything worked perfectly and continues to this day. I hope this helps.
 120v the power block is now internal so all you have is about a 5 foot power cord.
 Hello Angie. No, this wheel dont have any input for Microfone. You will need connect your headset to your controller.
 Yes it works in the US, and yes, it will charge your controllers until they are full, then it stops. I own this item, it works great!
 No, the charger has an automatic shutoff so it wont keep charging. Its designed to hold the controllers until you are ready to use.
 No, you just push down on the controller once set in the cradle and it clicks into place and starts charging. It\s instant.
 Light is either blue or off on the controller. I know when I first plug it in its an orangish color.
 No. You cannot use it to charge the headset.
 You can use old games - regular DS, 2DS and 3DS games work on it.
 yes
 ASIN B00EOAMRH6 is the pink color. The other colors have different ASINs.
 Unfortunately, the system that I received can only select English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese as languages.
 Youll have to link to the other device for specification. This is an XL model, which makes the screen bigger.
 I dont understand. Of course it will work for God of War, its just a standard PS3 controller. The buttons are incredibly responsive. The d-pad especially is wonderful, although Id expect you wont use that if GOW. The face buttons have nice rounded edges which is great for standard beat-em-up fare like rapid square/triangle combos. I have a callus on my thumb from playing Castle Crashers on a stock PS3 controller. The HORI works much better for me.
 Yes it comes with the cord. The cord is attached to it .
 Not sure about that unless you mean the two thumb controllers that rotate sorta like a gyroscope. It also has a turbo feature.
 Yes
 Yes, you can use it on several computers. The configuration is stored in the peripheral. Steph
 No, it only accepts on key press at a time at a time. There are some games or software where its quite handy (at replacing those awkward key reaches for crouching, ducking, throwing a grenade, or swapping weapons) there are other games (WASD) where its not as useful for steerage. It can do dual-key commands, but sadly it does not do macros. Its a niche product and takes a little bit of a learning curve to train yourself to use it. Its a very sturdy product that uses Cherry keys and will likely outlive me, but I do not use it in all situations.
 Yes, it does. It uses MX Cherry switches, so internally it works just like a keyboard.
 No - its very clicky in each of the four directions, and slightly sticky. Ive found that even just using it as arrow keys is difficult, w.r.t. getting precise motion.
 Just like a keyboard. Thing is great
 Yes, that is why I bought it, and it works good. Yes
 nope, only a mute button and a chat volume button
 Brother this wont work with ANY headset....save your money. Five bucks wasted is not a savings.
 it may its a 3.5 attachment
 I honestly dont know. I bought it for my turtle beaches. But ive yet to find anything that it actually fits. Wont work on tritons, razers, or turtle beaches. I wouldnt recommend you buy it.
 If you download the US version, youll be able to use the DLC. The hard copy is from Europe and they do not have DLC. I hope that answers your question.
 English, only the audio is in japanese

 Its on the physical disc, not a code or DLC you have to grab from the store.
 Right it is a move and click game which might not be for everyone. I enjoyed it and the game has a great story, which you are the creator of episode to episode.
 need set up with psn account otherwise waste money
 Nope. Its a good thing too, because that way you will only be subjecting a freshman in high school to some harmless violence (e.g., smashing a mans brain in with a pallet) instead of something truly horrific like sex.
 Third person except for a couple of shooting sequences in episodes 3, 4, and 5.
 Yes, it has nothing to do with tv itself, it is more related to the console region, but this one is region free so will work on any ps3.
 Yes it does , its an amazing game , you could also do a set of multiple characters and arrange them into fights to get to the top

 Is like a story mode with standar fighting check it out on you tube the game play if you like it
 Yea that is the cover and it does not have spanish subtitles, only English and French

 I can find no option in my version that allows for languages other than English.
 Yes you can.
 no it doesnt come with all the DLC you still have to buy some and the skins have to be purchased seperatly as well.
 The game provides a Steam Code. There is no DVD required to play the game.
) all of this must be bought separately
//www.systemrequirementslab.com
 Yes. BL2 is a Steamworks game.
 You dont need an internet connection to play it, and its kinda open ended, its linear in a Skyrim sense, but parts of the world can only be unlocked through story quests.
D
 Its on the disc it just installs it to your harddrive just make sure you have enough room on it.
 This just comes with dlc. You can still play as the gunzercer, siren, assasin, and soldier, but it adds the mechromancer and psycho. You meet the characters from the original game in the story.
 No. This game comes with all the latest updates, patches and DLCs. The DLCs for the game though you will need a hard drive for since they take up 4.5 space of storage.

 I dont know you tell me.
 Im not entirely sure but since theyre still selling it and sometimes products take awhile to move I would imagine there isnt an expiration date. At the very least it would probably be good until their next console comes out. However, like I said Im not that sure on this since I just did mine a couple of days after I got it. If youre thinking along the lines of holiday presents then I would say you would definitely be good there.
 No

 ours was brand new in the box. yes it has a 1 year warranty
 Gaming keyboards have faster reaction times
 The kb delivered to me is different. Amazon.com made a wrong delivery.
 No, but it look pretty awesome and fairly easy to setup.
 Yes. Just let it install the driver automatically.
 You can play directly from the disk. There are three discs, one for each game
 No
 The discs are in separate disc trays
 Yes, it has online multiplayer 4-8 players. It has an offline campaign of 1 player.
 If you mean all three games in one place as in three games on one disc, then no. But it is all three games in one place in that they took the three discs, discarded the original boxes, and put them all in one box. Since the games are unchanged aside from a missing case, the achievements do all still activate.
 Yes, it is excellent
 No it doesnt!
 Yes if they or you have wifi or Internet connection.
 You have to have an extra usb cord, cause it only comes with one. But if you have two chords there are 2 ports on the console, so you can charge both at the same time.
 No
 No it does not, it comes it a plastic clear box.
 this setup unpowers the charging stand, but the mouse is being charged by the cable. Not sure what frequency the wireless connection is, but the response time is nearly identical to the wired setup. I dont play FPS games, so I may not be aware of any differences that other programs or games would allow me to notice. As for other games, drawing and painting, designing etc, I cannot physically tell the difference between wired and wireless modes.
 Nope, changing from the wing to the flat side panel has no effect on the button, the panel lays over the button, also it\s default configuration is for DPI throttling. Hope this helps!
 Yes. Since it is USB 2.0/3.0 compatible it is capable of being used on any OS that has USB driver support (generally UPnP)
 You dont need a plug for it, it only needs an USB port
 I think u can

 I would say most games are better on an Xbox but the pc version of this game works really well. The graphics are great, colors are vivid and theres no lag time in play. I bought this version so our son could play it and not tie up our big screen TV. It was a great compromise for us.
 I did not try it on mac. I am using windows 7. But i think it should work on any PCs. As long as the origin server works on you pc, you should be able to play this games on that server.

 I bought it for my Grandson. It is approx 6 feet long. He dances around & jumps up & down in front of the Big-Screen. Plenty of room for that.
 No, but there are instructions on the box that will teach you how to wire/wrap your own cord. Just kidding, of course it comes with a cord.
 Yes
 Yes it will work for any windows platform.
 No, but it comes in a very professional box beside the control is awesome when u turn the light off, vibration is great, a really good investment I will buy a blue one as I got a green one ;)

 Im assuming its because not many people purchase this color, so the price is going low so people start buying it. Its not like its cheaper because its not functional or anything of the sort
 My son says his still works and works well.
 Its super cheap and will break quickly. I would not buy it.
 Theres a button on the back of the controller try pressing that. It should fix it if not then idk what it could be
 Yes it still will light up and vibrate.
 Yes, as long as you either have a spot to insert an SD card or you own an SD card reader you should be able to.
3) autostereoscopic (3D) LCD screen with a resolution of 800240 pixels (400240 pixels per eye, WQVGA) that is able to produce a three-dimensional effect without 3D glasses using a parallax barrier. According to a spec sheet from Nintendo, the screens on Nintendo 2DS are the same size as the current 3DS model. The upper screen measures 3.53 inches and the lower screen measures 3.02 inches. Those dimensions are smaller than the 3DS XL, which has screens 4.88 inches and 4.18 inches in size. Hoped this helped.
 Yes
 There is a share function between all DS\ but it requires the DS without the game to download it from the other and for the desired game to allow Download play. You should also probably note that the shared version of the game isn\t actually the full game and only allows limited content for the downloader; although the game is downloaded it is also required that the two DS\ stay within a close enough range to hold the wireless signal. If it\s a single player game you\ll most likely have to buy 2 but if it\s a game like Mario kart or multiplayer centered you could probably do fine just buying one and require the kids to be civil about who gets the full content or share.
 I have 2 children that have 2DS 12year and 10years old. They take them every were. The game cards and the styles are hard to keep track of. But they seem to keep going.

 hi it includes Manual, charger and stick!
 No
 Not sure whether you fixed the problem or not. Sorry for the late answer. It might be a bad ac adapter you have or the battery is dead.
 Yes to 3DS games and most of the regular games - as i was told by a Gamestop clerk.
 I cannot say definitively. This is Amazon, and they do have their customer guarantee policies for damaged/defective products. However, I purchased mine as a used product, so I cannot say a brand new version would not have a copy of Nintendos warranty provided with it. That being said however, I do believe that some form of a product warranty would be available to you since you are buying this product from an Official buyers/traders marketplace.
 Yes, I imported the vita to the uk and had no problem with changing the language. The only problem I have encountered is with some games the x and o buttons swap functionality.
 Some qr cards you probably wont use. The system itself a charger (that was surprisingly long) and some manuals in Japanese. Theres not much to it other than that.
 Yes, sony products are not region locked. So it can play any american game / Japanese games!
 Definitely not true. Ive had mine for.... Well, I while, at least six months or so and its still kicking haha. My friend has an American version and he prefers mine due to the color. Cuz thats really the only difference! Sounds like your friend just hates happiness and color, cuz thats what you get with the Japanese vita xD

 PS Vita TV is a stand alone high definition console version that connects to your television. It will not stream from a PS Vita handheld system! The Japanese PS Vita TV system is very limited in the US with most games and app service not able to operate. YouTube will not work work on a PS Vita tv , but works on a Vita handheld system! Crazy!!! You have to have a Japanese Playstation account to use it!! No option to connect a US account! An US version is going to be released in October 2014 and hopefully open all the locked out apps and games. It will stream video and games from a Playstion 4 console, but seem to lose connection quite a bit for me. Hopefully after the US release all these problems will be worked out. The system has great potential, but Sony seems to be holding it back and letting it die like the Vita handheld.
 Yes
 Not for me.
 No it has to be plugged into the ps4 for it to work.
 My American games work just fine on it. Pretty sure games from any region will work on it though.
 Can you state your question in more detail. The vita is packaged with an original Japanese box therefore the package does contain Japanese words describing the vita. The only English words on the box are PSVITA, SONY, Lime and Green/White.
 Yes
 Yes u can play all english games, and save all your game saves on the 1gb storage without a memory card. If u decide to buy a memory card later on all saves will transfer over to new memory card.
 Yeah Ive had mine for a while too, and havent encountered any problems with the wireless, however sometimes the joystick becomes unresponsive and moves my character spuratically.
 Its for playing vita games on your television. . But it is region locked and you must open a Japanese PSN account. I like mine would just love it if it was region locked
 Its not on the list. And only few us titles can be played on vita Tv..........
 Yes
 Nothing except the color and name. They are both the exact same thing.
 You cant create NA account because its region-locked. Itll allow you to update to new firmware like any other console.
 Yessir David, works perfectly just like a chip from here. I got mine in the mail not too long ago and couldnt be happier with all the space it has on it
(sal/small post) is about 10~14days to US .
 You could sell it.
 Seems to be about the same as the 4GB card, but that is just based upon loading times when I used both. Havent attempted to test with my PC for fear of possible accidental damage to the card.
 More than any other memory card, depends on game size or movie size, some games are 500mb up to 6+gigs same with movies. It just gives you the maximum amount of room to budget on one memory stick.
 Online gaming and the PlayStation store both work normally and you will have no problems. The only difference between a US Vita and Japan version that I can tell is that the circle button okays things and the X button backs up out of menus.
 Hello. I can ship this item to Cambodia.
 Yeah
 It supports quite a few languages. You select the language during setup.
 No
 Yes. I got this for my kids for Christmas and it is pretty much the same thing as a regular wii but can not connect to wifi. It is also just different color. Plays all the wii games but not wii u games. Hope this helps.
 It is not capable of any form of HD as it only ouputs 480i via a RCA cable.
 Yes, they work.
 Every Wii game we tried with it works great (old and new).
 Yes it does.
 Hi. Yes English or in German. You can choose when you install the game. So to answer your question is has both.
 The DVD is needed to install the game. It is not needed to play the game.
 You could claw if you want to. The ergonomics are good for palming though.
 Yeah, any USB mouse will work on a macbook!
 to be honest thats not something i have tried to do. sorry i couldnt be more help. but i really like the mouse, if remapping is a deal breaker maybe look at something else just to be safe, but if its not this mouse is very cool
 No you can play the first disc...or install the dlc from the 2nd...once you install it...it goes to your hard drive...both are not needed...hope this helps.
 I think because of the violence , blood , some gore, there is also a brothel, and just the subject matter over all else. But Those are the only reasons that I can think of. And why they gave it an M rating.
 Yes
 I dont believe so since it never ask me for one. It just uses the internal that is there. the only reason I can think of why it would require an additional hard drive is if your drive is full. you might want to check that and delete any old saves you dont need any longer.
 Yes
 A little over 8 ft, but the controller itself is wireless. It just uses a USB drive and the cable is just used for charging.
 I bought the controller for my 10 yr.old grandson and he loves it.he likes playing in the dark for the illusion of the light. It was a Christmas gift. I compared it at other stores and it was the same thing but cost more. I recommend the item.
 Yes
 This controller is just a Dualshock controller. It does not have Sixaxis support
 It is a wired keyboard. Ive been happy with mine; performs great, back-lit keys are nice. Only thing i could even rag on is that i wish the Volume control knob was more sensitive. I have to spin it more than i would like to raise/lower volume. If thats my only complaint, I think you will like this keyboard. Also, I game and have never had a problem with pressing to many keys etc. and it has a windows key disabling function so you dont tab out of your games or anything else. Cheers!
 Yes it is a USB keyboard. Overall a nice keyboard for the price!
 Yes, absolutely. With the backlight off, it is just like any other keyboard. The characters are clear and a good size.
 Yes, it is
 no
 Having the lights on does take a lil from the battery without sacrificing allot of power. Note these are led lights and do not consume not as m much power as you think. But having them off will give you about 30 minutes of extra use after a full charge
 yes, but are overpriced and too fragile
 The tower replace it
 All I can tell you is that I have used the headset for quite a number of hours now and I cant spot any obvious wear and tear on them. Still look and function like new.
 Yes. Until PS4 patches a third party Ian audio problem, you will have to use the plug to hardwire them into the controller. Cord goes from line in on headset to bottom audio jack on controller. The problem reportedly will be taken care of, but while it\s not patched it doesn\t allow for you to adjust Game-Chat audio OR the volume from the headset. You must use the settings on the ps4 menu to adjust volume and game-chat is standard. The only headset actually in full function with ps4 now that I know of is the PS4 gold headset, but with the patch on the way, this one is an obvious choice for me. Quality is amazing and super cool looking.
 0.8lbs
 yes, however, mine only lasted about 3 months before it stopped charging
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my daughter. Alot of people said you can use an adapter and plug it into the wall just as you would a phone.
 I dont know about others but For me its just perfect...nice product
 Funciona exelentemente, solo es un poco incomodo para colocar los controles
 no in single player only. No co-op or multiplayer. You might also consider the redux version at this point. It had better graphics and improved gameplay over the original.

 Its genuine leather and the stitching on the ear cups is superb. Also, the leather is soft to the touch.
 Yes
 I did not get a hard case.
 No
 You just need buy dc adapter for 220v or give current to engineer, they can change from 110v to 220v. Told from my experinece
 Yes there is a USB connection.
 If you have Xbox 360 with the kinetic device, all you need is good space to dance on.
 The package that I purchased included one controller. I purchased a second wireless controller separately.
 Im not sure it will work in Europe. The console is NTSC which is made for US and Canada. The power plug is a two prong Input AC 100-127V 3.7A
 You can, BUT you will have to buy a different power supply. I bought a 220v power supply through Amazon for about $23. The power supply that comes with the US version is only for 110v.
 This bundle has everything he needs to play the system. You will still need an Xbox Live card in order to play online which is $60 a year. If you have a High Definition TV you will also need to buy an HDMI cord in order to play at the highest definition.
 It depends on the bundle! I received a disk with Halo 3, and a code for Tomb Raider. Read the description carefully!
 Yes
 It was supposed to come with Halo (which it did), a token for Tomb Raider (not there) and a free subdcription to Xbox Live (got that).
 football, baseball,, regular tennis, boxing, darts
 Yes
 The XBox 360 does have access to Amazon Instant Video if you have an XBox Live account and an Amazon Prime account, however it only lets you watch the free videos or ones you have purchased from the website (it does not have a storefront).
 Yes if it is for Xbox 360
 You need to activate it
 yes. it happens to me too rarely though. I suspect is the software and not the keyboard it self. I also use the arrows to drive.
 yes you can pretty much bind all keys to anything you want and save it to a profile if you want. The software roccat software is pretty awesome with plenty of options. They make it very easy to change things how ever you like. I even made my T2 key an extra esc key. I definitely recommend this board dude not because of all the lights and flashy things but bc its simply a great keyboard.
 The roccat Ryos Series keyboards are blue led only. If you want a keyboard that can change the led colors you could get the ROCCAT Isku FX keyboard. The Color of the Cherry Switches (Blue, brown, red, black) does not define the color of the leds.
 Yes it does,but you have to use it with the USB sound card and SteelSeries software. The volume for that feature is adjustable.
//steelseries.com/products/audio/steelseries-cross-platform-audiomixer You need this audiomixer for the steelseries siberia elite to be compatible with your ps4.
 open-ended
 Hay una tarjeta de sonido USB que viene con el producto. No se requiere para su uso si desea utilizar las tomas de audio Auriculares / Mic Sin embargo, si desea utilizar las funciones de software , es necesario tener el auricular conectado a la tarjeta de sonido USB .
 I have a 23.5inch/~60cm round head measuring just above the ears. For me they have held up really well and stay comfortable.
 I dont think so, but since Roccat still hasnt released a Windows 8.1 version I cant test it.
 Keyboard is qwerty with number pad yes
 There does seem to be some problems with one person I see bashing this product online. Searching this device and 8.1 drivers he has flooded a lot of forums, improperly. I have not one problem with this keyboard, except when playing around 3rd partys lightshow programs. I would have to uninstall Roccat Power Grid (optional software, that allows some lightshows and control through smartphone apps) and re-install drivers and firmware on the keyboard using Roccats updater and things work as normal as when I first got it. I have learned that most other lightshow programs and controls are outlived with support or just are not finished entirely to a well polished transition back to normal. But looking on Roccats website it does in fact support window 8 and further reading on forums indicate that people have been using it with windows 8.1 since driver Roccat 1.30 and firmware version 1.25. I strongly believe it is user error when installing software and hardware, their are instructions on how to do this, like, when to plug in your keyboard when installing this onto your PC, lays a big hand to success.
 If you are plugging this keyboard into a computer that has usb 1.0 ports, no. If you are plugging a usb 1.0 into one of the usb 2.0 ports on the keyboard, yes.
 I asked a rep and they said its US layout
 Ive been using the Rea Arcade on PC for a while and I dont have any problems with it.
 It is square at the diagonal points. I am comfortable with it, but the octagonal plate is easy swap.
 Yes
 It should. You may have to update the mix amp on the Astro website. But I didnt buy the pc splitter. So you may have to purchase one sepretly or unless you can find one that comes with it.
 For the Xbox one. The bass is too loud
 Yes it comes with the Mix Amp. I had to follow instructions on a YouTube video because I had issues setting it up. It did not come with instructions.
 Yes it should be. Call customer support or even better if they have live chat support let them know. Theyll probably have you send the broken cable to them and they will send you a replacement
 It has Left Stick/Right Stick/D-Pad capability, so it should work. I probably wouldnt suggest using it for a real 3D game but if you want to then go right ahead
 This one is slightly more solid over all the the qanba. It has a standard square gate and the buttons are slightly smaller and smoother also. I own both a qanba and madcatz te stick and if I had to just one for lasting quality and performance it would be the madcatz te. It feels the most comfortable and is the easiest to mod if you so choose.
 No Any Game That Requires the use of both the left and right analog stick it wont work sorry
 Its a little difficult. The art already on it is one big sticker. You will either have to have something printed with an adhesive backing or buy a plexi top.
 No, If your looking for a Xbox One fight stick, Madcatz makes the Tournament Edition 2, and Razer makes the Atrox.
 Yes. You need a cthulu board for xbox360. It is an absolute pain in the ass from what I hear though.
 It is wired.
 No its just for ps3
 As long as you have the right drivers installed it should work.
 no it does not
 No it does not. You can get the wii u fit with board but not sure the meter comes with. I would shop around to see what yiu can find.
 Yes, more than one player may play at a time; however, it wont accumulate your data, time, or anything else that we saw. We only tried it once. We took turns back and forth trying to beat each other on a specific game/exercise but it did not keep our results. There is a 2 people run activity, but we have not done that one. Maybe we just werent doing it correctly.
 Per my son, he received 60 coins.
 Yes. It comes with larger pads to put on when used on carpet.
 Yes.

 The balance board itself is compatible with the Wii. However, the Wii Fit U game and fit meter are only compatible with the Wii U.
 Well, basically the space it takes for the board, and the space for one person standing with the board in front of them (for stepping on and off exercises. 4 square feet? Obviously more would be better.
 A Wii U is required to play this. Once you have a Wii U, this box includes everything you need to play Wii FIT U.
 Yes.
 The balance board will work for the Wii, the game only works on WiiU

 The headset is hardwired into the remote (the remote is not wireless) and the remote plugs into a usb port on your computer
 Yes
 Unfortunately the only thing the Bluetooth is able to connect to is a smart phone. As for cable connectivity, it is not intended for consoles. If you want a headset that is surround and for consoles then I would suggest something along the lines of astro, triton, or turtle beach headsets.
 Yes. Right Click volume icon &gt; volume control options &gt; playback tab &gt; select KAVE XTD Headset &gt; properties &gt; Levels tab &gt; turn microphone up to 100
 No
 Yes
 Nope. Windows only.
 Yes
 Nope. Windows only.

 Yes, on the surface it appears that its just one additional act but its a long act. There are also new additions and changes made to the whole game. there is a new character to play thru all 5 acts now. There are minor changes to the gems, one being that they added a new one. to level up the blacksmith and jeweler no longer requires pages or books but deaths breathes. with the changes and the additions it is well worth the money to get the expansion pack just dont get the collectors edition. Once your character makes it all the way thru act v there is this whole other world-Adventurer Mode and rifts to play thru. So to answer your question yes its just one act but there are still so much more to it than just an additional act. If you love D3 then get the expansion youll love it even more...
 You can download the software straight from blizzard one you have the serial number. So of you purchase it you simple need to give the key that comes in the box to your friend. You may also be able to purchase it through blizzard as a gift and they will email a key to that person.
 Only if you buy multiple copies. Blizzards policy is one copy, one player. Your wife/husband, girlfriend/boyfriend, children, and friends can not play your copy. It is grounds for account termination.
 Yes
 The one I received from this company has 12. There are 3 rows of 4 in the case I bought for my son.
 Yes, you could play it in the case but it might hinder some gameplay
 Yes
 Yes. Just the case and the small wrist carry strap.
 Its a seasonpass for the whole series, but so far only episodes 1 to 3 have been released. As the series continues, the new episodes will be made available to you.
 No, it sadly cant be played through Steam as the DRM says it is for TellTale Games Account. However, Steam is now having a 50% sale of that game. Go get it right now! Its only $12.49! ;)
 The actor is Adam Harrington. Hes a voice actor who has worked on several video games including telltales Walking Dead series.
 Call Amazon customer support and they will walk you through it.
 Easy...you need to first load the Demo....at the end of the Demo it will unlock the other episodes. the DEMO confirms your purchase after it ends
 Yup! I am currently running Windows 7 and it works just fine!
 No
 A little over 5 feet.
 It comes with square gate installed and the circular and octagonal gates in the box.
 I am not experienced with doing so because it comes with it. So I would have to strip the wire and add a new one. Which wouldnt look as nice. In all, pretty hard to replace.
 Yes
 open-ended
 Yes. There is an story Mode that follow an interesting storyline
 No sir honest
 I doubt it. I have had issues, in the past, with purchasing video games from retailers outside my home region. I would strongly recommend that you find a retailer in your home region to buy this from. I cant say for certain that you would have a problem buying this from an American retailer, but I would not risk it.
 Yes it should have full Latin Spanish but I wouldnt know because I use it in English but the game does have language settings.
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes
 You have to put in codes to get the DLC so it is not recommended that you buy it used.
 No, sadly, it actually doesnt, the fotus armor was only included in the limited console edition
 Imdb states that the game has very mild language such as hell and damn used occasionally.
 There is some mild language, really no further than damn or hell. I really never have understood the M rating on the Halo series. However, it is a shooter and thus you will be shooting things and though the violence is a mild form in comparison to other games. It still implies death and I think that is where it gets it\s ratings mostly. I really find this game to ne more of a T for Teen rating, but then again, maybe I\m just desensitized...
 yes, it comes with all maps (addon); i am a halo fan and I bought this a few months ago and was the best choice and you will save a lot of money instead buying this games separately, so grab it because it worth it
 It charges till its full then auto shuts off. Problem is after a while, it charges for 30 seconds then shuts off. Seems like batteries die easily. Hope this helps
 Ive always used the nyko chargers. They work pretty well and last a long time.
 That I am not sure on. I would contact Nyko on it.
 You can charge two engines and one device
 I havent try the Rayovac, I always have NYKO. I believed the battery has a lifetime warranty on it.
 At first I thought no, but it actually telescopes out enough for my google nexus 7. It still had about an inch more of telescoping it could do
 will this clip fit with a bluetooth keyboard attached to the controller as well?
 open-ended
 The clip opens up pretty far, Im sure it would
 Yes it will support phones up to 5.3
 Im sorry this wont answer your question, but for both to break within 6 months seems that it could be a defective product or batch. Ive had mine for quite a while now, and my fingers never come across touching or bumping the dongles (and I have large hands). I have never had an issue sliding them back into their base. They work amazingly. I wish I knew where I put the original packaging to see what the warranty was, but it will NEVER hurt to contact them and explain your situation. Nyko has been great about handling defective accessories. If you have the documents that came with the unit, contact them. If not, you probably can find their customer service connection on their website to address the situation. I hope this helps a little. ~C
 Yes it will stop charging once the controller has fully charged
 The charge base doesnt, however Nyko makes a battery pack that is compatible with this base that does and it works very well. The wonderful thing about the charge base is you dont have to fight with the micro USB plug to recharge your controller. You plug the dongle in and its the last time you have to deal with that stupid plug.
 Nope works with gravity hahaha its the only thing making the pins charge the controller there is no clip o holder just gravity
 open-ended
 Yes Sandra.
 Although I am not sure if it will work on a foreign account. Im pretty sure it will though. The code does not get emailed, it is shipped to the address that you put in for the order. Enjoy! Its a great game.
 You have to download it to your xbox 360 first. Then it will be available for free on your xbox one. If your consoles share the same xbox live account.
 Sorry we cannot.
 I already shipped this back to you. It was a quick turnaround back to you. I shipped it back the same way that you sent this to me. It was a return to sender package. You did not have the disc inside.
 The game looks amazing....the story line is short and its the actions are limited and repetitive. It would be a lot cooler if you could venture off into the world but you cant.
 Not really. You have a sword and a shield, X uses your sword and Y uses the shield. There really aren\t combos to speak of other than going back and forth with a combination of your sword and shield. Some enemies require a heavy attack where you hold in X or Y and it will break their guard. You hitB to do a roll move, which you will need to do for some enemies. It\s a beautiful game though and the multiplayer is pretty fun if you have a friend to play with. Worth it if you can find it used.
 This game is played via controller only though one has the ability to control legions with voice commands via Kinect.
 Every time you have to finish an enemy off he glows the color of the buttons you have to press, so its basically lots quick time events without the actual buttons showing up on the screen, But you will be doing Very short quick time events throughout the whole game.

 Yes, the 2015 mustang is a free dlc
 No steering wheel needed. I personally like to play on the controller since I am used to it but if you really want to, there is a wheel for the xbox one called the Thrustmaster TX Racing wheel that you can buy for about 200 bucks. And there are also some optional add ons. But no, you dont need a wheel.
 Cant earn all of them...gotta buy with real money...sucks.
 A lot of what this game does well to set itself apart from previous installments is features such as drivatars, new vibration system, improved physics, and advanced visuals. These things are for the most part probably not possible on the 360, so what would be the point to release Forza 5 with less content and features on last gen without these new additions to the franchise? I really dont see any.
 No. Forza Motorsport 5 is only playable on the Xbox One entertainment system. Forza 4 and Forza Horizon are two racing games, from the same franchise, that are available on the Xbox 360.

 You can only play DR3 on Xbox One and not on the Xbox 360. This game takes full advantage of the Xbox Ones new hardware, especially the Kinect.
 Well it depend on you. If you really enjoy play kill zombies or something. I like this game. I not really play this game a lot. I love build new gadget, vehicles, and ETC. If you play deadrising 2 and you like it then you will love deadrising 3. I promise.
 It installs the same amount whether you get a hard copy or a digital. Only difference is youre pulling from a disk rather than downloading it using your Internet speed so it goes faster(unless you have blazing Internet speed). There may be a slight difference, but not enough to choose one or the other.
 Yes
 Yes. Our inventory is 100% original products of Sony Computer Entertainment.
 Thats right. It is a product that Sony has produced.
 Hey J, I found the software nomenclature to be a bit confusing. Mode, was not clearly defined. This turned out to be your profiles. They are selected with a button on the bottom of the Venus mouse. Each of the five different profiles (mode 1-5) has an indicator color which lights the scroll wheel. In the profile setup you have a series of five DPI presets each with a pair of sliders for x and y axis. Generally you would want the x-y to be parallel. But for a special program use you may want it slow left and right and fast up and down. In that case the x-y sliders would not be parallel. These are selected from within the current profile (mode) with the up-down arrows behind the scroll wheel. This will light up a series of 1 to 5 lights on the top of the mouse indicating which DPI setting you have engaged. You may like 5 lights but prefer a slower setting just pull the x-y sliders down to the desired setting in the 5th DPI.

 You should be able to bind them to anything, usually it binds to keyboard key(s), anything in photoshop that can bind to key(s) is thus covered by this.
 It is easy to start up and easy to use to set up the keys. The starting keys itself is already fine meaning you dont need to set up all your mouse bindings if you dont mind a standard mouse set up with the side keys 1-12 being hotkeys for the 1-12 numbers of your keyboard and if you want to change any of the bindings an image on the in software key set up will show you what option corresponds to what on your mouse making it really straight forward. Its been a super easy time using it in general.

 no they the cows mile themselfs. they walk through a automatic milking machine
 My son said , to pick up eggs just walk over them. Use a hay bailer and place in pasture or stalls to feed cows. Hope this helps
 Your chickens are in one spot and you cannot change where or how they are kept. The cows are fed buy grass, straw and chaff that you collect and have to mix for the best feed. As far as organic farming, you either use fertilizers bought and filled on your farm or get it from raising cows. There are you two choices. This is a limited game.
 The only business involved is running your farm, improving with better equipment, keeping out of debt, there is not a way to set prices but there are demands for crops that pay higher prices during limited times.
 It is very realistic..and fun to play

 It can rest horizontally.

 It now includes all the expansions except Warlords.
 This is the one that you have to start with. The rest of them are expansion packs you add to this original software. When I purchased this I thought I was getting the version in the picture (the newest release date version) but was sent the original box version. From my understanding there isnt much difference and I did make the company that ships this aware of it. Customer service was IMPECCABLE. They were very prompt and courteous in emails.
 Yes it does.
 In this case you should buy Mist of Pandarian as well. So the pandaren character would be included. Now since you played a trial I really dont know if your character will be deleted. Im a new player on WOW and I was requested to create an original character from the initial game at lvl 50it will allow you to create other characters from the other expansions

 Yes, it happend to me a couple weeks after I bought it. Also, I could not down load new updates.
 This item is specifically for the SLIM because of its design. This drive inserts into the body of the slim through a door that opens on the end. It slides in and attaches and you shut the door back. This would not work on any other xbox.
 yes this will work fine
 Hey, yes it does!
 No
 Yes it is. It gives you great aiming with sniping and any other weapon.
 Im pretty sure that they will work.

 Yes. Register the device with Nintendo. It can be transferred, from card to card, but I was unsuccessful. (even tried calling Nintendo support) Fortunately, once your device is registered, you can download the game for free from the eshop.
 No. Just 110v
 The bottom screen is touch-enabled, and generally it works really well, even without the stylus. A lot of 3DS games make use of the bottom screen in all sorts of novel ways, and some of that requires a finer point than just your finger can offer.
 Check to be sure the listing says New. If its new & unopened you should receive it in its original Nintendo packaging (factory sealed) with all the included accessories & manual. If its new & unopened (factory sealed) it is Never Shrink-Wrapped. I know this to be a fact because I worked in the Nintendo (formerly Pokmon) store in NYC & all factory sealed boxes come with a special stickers on each end that when peeled open even gently it is obvious that it was unsealed to prevent tampering, etc. This is also true for all the other gaming consoles (XBox 360 XBox One, PS3 & PS4, Wii & Wii U, etc, even the old game systems & handhelds from years ago). All retail employees can tell if it was opened & will not take it back unless of course you are selling it back as used for way less even if it was just purchased 5mins prior. Good luck everyone.

 It could help but it is not necessary. Entirely different story.
 About 5lb.
 yeah, its take some force to adjust to fit your TV. i was scared at first but its a lot more durable then you think it it.
 No, it isnt required. The Kinect sensor is bundled with most Xbox One consoles (it was required with mine but you can buy the console without the Kinect now). Research the Kinect. Its cool. I have young kids so I didnt want them to play with the Kinect so I bought this to mount it up high. The Kinect can sit by the TV but it looks like it belongs on top, with this bracket installed.
 Curve shouldnt be a problem. The kinect can be tilted up and down there is a hinge
 Yes. It has a stand that you have to be very gentle pulling it out. Once you pull it out put on your TV and adjust it.
 Yes most definitely i have mine set ontop of a 24 inch monitor. the only question is if it can hold the weightof thekinect wihtout tipping over your monitor. Mine can, howevr i do not now how much yours can hold. the mount is super light so really just take into consideration the weight of the kinnect and make your decision from there.
 Yes
 You need to buy the new game Disney 2.0 which comes with the new portal. Characters from 1.0 will work on the new 2.0 portal.
 Yes, all figures can be used in Wii U, if you have the Wii U Infinity Base.
 Yes, but this bundle contains most of the figures.
 These are add on pieces. In order to play you need the starter pack which includes three characters, game and activation base. These work for every game system that you have the base and game for.

 I got it for new battlefield as it needed hard drive (I have Xbox 360 with 4gigs). Worked good, it extends your memory so I dont see a reason why it wouldnt work with original games
 Basically, yes, it is inserted in the top of the Xbox when you remove the slats. This one is for Xbox 360 slim.
 You can play Wii games on it but not Gamecube games!
 hard copy, one disk of both games.
 32GB
 That is not a Wii console (last generation) that is the Wii U console (current generation). The Controller is the pad on the left in the picture with the Wii U logo on the screen. So just to be clear this does not include a Wii this is a new console called the Wii U. It will play Wii games, but will not play the Gamecube games like the Wii was able to do.
 To be honest I dont know I dont play that long. I bought the nyko pro controller and I could always use that if the game pad ran out. Its a great controller and 20 bucks
 It doesnt have english subtitles Ive found but you can find translations of menus online Easily. Ive tried to connect to online and it has not proved feasible. Maybe you can find a way. There are many configurations and every time I get to the competitor confirmation screen, it takes me back to the previous screens so I suppose that is a decline.
 Nop

 I googled S5 showing the S5 is with 4.8 screen. It fits the holder, which can support 8.2cm maximum.
 Hello, yes it does work with iPhone or any device with Bluetooth
 I dont think you can.
 It has a bonus High School Mode.
Demon of the Fleeting Blossom, but it has other features and a bonus game that you can unlock.
 Im not a sophisticated gaming user, but I have a fingertip grip and it works OK for me. Note that the side buttons (on the left side of the mouse) are probably better placed for a palm grip. As with any mouse, youre best off trying it in a store before buying if at all possible.
 i dont have a g500 but I do have g400s and DA,rival has the same LOD as g400s which is pretty low.

 Yes, it should work with most if not all Mac OS versions.
 Yes
 Unfortunately it does NOT come with the pre-order bonus. Which sucks, since I ordered this in March. I had to buy the DLC separately on July 16th.
//store.steampowered.com/. You can download a software there that allows you to install games to your computer and play them from this software platform. Games from steam usually come at great discounts. Imagine downloading a playstation interface to your computer. Its like having a playstation account. Instead its from a provider called Steam, and thus it is a Steam Account.
 Yes, once you already downloaded it, the game as well as your saves, are saved onto your hard drive. So you can definitely play it offline.
 No. Its boring and annoying. What could have been a fun and immersive experience is bogged down by necessary game scenarios (hit three switches) and after the monster finds you and kills you a few times, the game turns from scary to annoying and frustrating. The fact that you have no weapons to fend yourself off makes things scary at first, but eventually becomes just lame because only being able to run pads out the game since you have to retrace your steps again once a chase is over. It wasnt fun at all and I never finished it.
 Its a steam code. You purchase it here on amazon, go figure lol. But this game though lol. This game i dont recommend for the faint hearted.

 Yes this fits the new one
 Yes when attached it charges the PS Vita first then the Battery in the Grip. It is advised to power the PS Vita off if you want it to fully charge.

 2200mAh It quite good grip, perfect fit in the hand, but durability is really awful
 Memory card yes, game slot no.

 definitely. the only real things that may feel the same is the overworld map being almost identical in a lot of areas and the overall playability. which isnt a bad thing. its very smooth and fun to play. the dungeons are all different. a lot of cool new puzzles and weapons etc. i think youd have a lot of fun with this if youre a fan of the original.
 I dont believe so. Sorry.
 Nope. You need a 3ds
 Nintendo games are region locked, so I\d lean toward not compatible. I\m not sure exactly where you look for definitive proof though.
 He can only be controlled with the circle pad
 Sorry, but in my case, the disc doesnt came with the console. Really shame. Amazon must be send me this game.
 Si viene en espaol e ingles
 Yes it does. It plays them perfectly
 Very good
 No
 Yes of course. I cant remember any wii games cant play on wiiu, Btw get mario kart bundle better
 Hi, yes you can. Im using a SD card on my Wii U and it works fine.
 With the basic set your 2gb has to cover game saves for wii u games and downloads However the easy solution is get a usb 3.0 powered hdd from amazon and exponecolly expand your very limited storage with a 2-3 TB hdd you can even dl full games from e-shop want smash faster dl it the day of release. Best advice get a external powered hdd.
 I believe the stated maximum is 32GB, but I would expect that it would support twice that (as many devices do). If youre youre considering using a large flash memory card as game storage ... commercial flash memory has a limit on the number of times you can write over it is not recommended as devices for long-term storage of downloaded games or save data. You can get an inexpensive external hard disk drive for around the same $30/$40 as many large capacity SD cards. An 80Gb or 160 Gb drive can be purchased for under $30.
 No, this was the best wii deal I found on internet. Go for it, I love mine.
 Yes you can play with 1,2,3 or 4 players.
 Not sure about the move , Currently the PS4 does not support Sounds of the show because there is no Audio software .
 I think they please Canadian customers putting the picture of a Canadian player (or a Canadian team, for istance Toronto) on the cover. the game is exactly the same.
 Idk
 Yes
 Its totally normal, the manual is online
 Amazon should email you a code in which you have to input that at the skinit website, the link to that website is also included in the email
 I dont believe this or any other game has cross platform play at this time, not 100% sure though.
 Just the controller
 Yes, with the season pass you have the access to skill bundles too.

 Its just the DLC for the game

 I am not sure on this particular game as I have not played online yet. I did download a roster that I liked better than what the game had, but usually they give you a code that works or the playstation store has a free one. When I went into the online screen on accident it acessed it and did not mention anything about needing an online pass.
 Yes, the roster its updated every week
 Yes
 no but what would you want no blu ray, the console plays blu ray
 Although, some people have uploaded rosters with them on it that are free to download
 Yes
 Players regularly retire, however it is the players that would expect, i.e. late thirties, lack of ability, etc. In RTTS I have noticed that the AI makes what I can only call, ridiculous trades. You\ll see your stars get traded away early in the season for scrubs, or minor league talent. In RTTS you will see some player retire earlier than expected. The unrealistic trade logic does impact franchise mode as well. Since Kershaw is under 35 I would presume that he would be good for quite a few years. I caution you in purchasing this game. If you can get a good deal on the cost, go for it, otherwise be warned as the AI is terrible in this game. The fielding mechanics are not what they were in previous MLB games and lead to a lot of frustration. The other major glaring issues in this game is that you will be picked off at will by the AI, your pickoff attempts WILL go into the stands at least once a game, and the online portion of this game has not worked since the game was released.
 I myself could not afford ps4 but bought mlb 14 for ps3. So far online play was extremely bad. Very choppy online play. Issues with responsiveness and graphics issues. If I knew that I would have just kept playing mlb13 and then upgrade to ps4 next year after the bugs are out.
 yes theyare good
 Yes, you should be able to do so. I havent tried it, but the point of a cloud based game is that you can play anywhere. It may get a bit more complicated if you want to play the same offline city on both though.
 This includes both the main game and the expansion.
 Yes, this works on Windows 8 (and 8.1).
 You can change the language. I believe you can select your language when you install it.
 Yes. The game has two modes. A Single Player mode and Multiplayer mode. Multiplayer requires an Internet connection. You will NOT be able to play multiplayer mode on LAN. The multiplayer mode requires an internet connection with an Origin account, while Simcity is updated to the latest version. In Multiplayer mode, you can create a game or even join other games. A game refers to a region where you have multiple cities. You could invite friends and your son to play in the same region. Since you want to play a multiplayer game with your son, I am assuming you would be purchasing the game once. The game purchase can only be registered with a single Origin account. A single Origin game account allows you to install the game on multiple PCs with the same account. This would technically allow your son and yourself to play the game with this account on different PCs. However, a single account can only be logged in once. Meaning, both of you cant play at the same time. So in order to play the game at the same time, you would need to purchase the game twice, have two separate Origin accounts, one for yourself and your son. This would allow multiplayer at the same time. The other mode is the single player mode. This mode does not require a persistent Internet connection to play. The game data will be stored on your PC rather than on Servers. For the single player mode, you can play the game even though your Orgin account is in offline mode. I am assuming this may allow you and your son to play a single player game without internet on two different PCs at the same time as long as the origin account is set to offline mode on both the PCs. I could be wrong though. Hope This answer helped.
 You can use your keyboard. I use it too, but its not comfortable. When you want to do a bigger combo, it is impossibble to make it succesfull. So I recommend controller to play.
 I have a wired xbox 360 game controller, I just plugged it in the USB port of my computer and the game automatically recognized it. It also asks you when you about to play a match to Press the Accept Button on the controller you want to use, so Ive had no problems using the xbox 360 controller for this game. Not sure how a wireless controller would work.
 YEP as long as your normal audio works This should work As always get the latest drivers for your audio card Check settings in game
 store.steampowered.com
 Ofcourse you can
 Yes it does through steam. It has same screen multi-player but No LAN support though...

 I havent played every game but I know that adventure 1 & 2 , generations, and both racing games support gamepads
 The pack is played through steam so youll need to have an account with them first before downloading the game. All of this requires an internet connection but to actually play the games there should be an offline mode in steams settings.

 It is only a demo, its not the full game
 No. And for future reference, avoid trolling on this site, and actually ask some questions that need to be answered.
 All xbox 360s are supposed to have a hard drive . Some Units require a slim hard drive or up to a 250 that snaps in place on the top of the xbox . You need to figure out which type you need . If its the older style 360 2nd hand drives are available cheap if you look . Make sure its a OEM hard drive not a fake from china. In the mean time you can maybe hook up a large thumb drive like 32gb or 64 and could play some games till you get the right drive . I would suggest the 250 GB cause the space goes fast and is used for other things like demos , videos etc. I hope this helps. Ash
 No apparently it won\t for any format (one PS4 included) it won\t - however; it will probably come Later as an extra included with some GOTY if the T.P.P. game goes there (?) - unless the ground Zero demo won\t come at all , and it will turn into some expensive source of income for fans & collectors and speculator via e-bay and amazon sellers . The all point of it is that it was an overpriced game-play demo specifically made for the hype of T.P.P. and Kojioma (The king of the Hideo cames) just showed that supporting him and his talent does not come for free. A bit like if Spielberg made us pay to see the trailer of his next movie. I conclude Video games industry even in Japan is rotten through the bones.
 Yes. I have win 8 64 bit and it works fine.
 I think the gold has all the dlc
 thats typically an issue of your power supply either failing or not supplying adequate power.
 Yes because it will be stored into your steam account. If you do not have a steam account you need it to download the game
 Robert, thats an interesting question. I have always had Java installed in all my systems, and graphical things seemed to work better than not. I have never explored this game specifically to see if it plays better without Java, but it seems to play great with my existing profile. I dont experience the types and number of glitches that most forums are reporting. I hope this helps you.
 Should be. I run it on Windows 8.1 with no problems, and 8.1 has more issues with gaming than 7 did in my experience.
 As far as I know, youd have to just replay the memory sequence through the progress tracker.
 No, Pure1 connects with ONE device at a time. But you can switch between different devices. I alwasy switch between my cell phone and tablet. When driving, i connect it with my cell phone. At home, i connect it with my tablet.
 I dont know!!
 No, only a small guide in hard copy.
 Through micro usb port on the headset

 Your characters levels, gear, vendors and stash are all saved together. When you transfer to PS4, all of that will be transfered.
 No
 Yes you can
 On the PC version, yes, you need to be online. On the console versions, you do not.
 This Ultimate Evil Edition contains both Diablo III and the Reaper of Souls expansion set, together in one definitive volume. There is other DLC available, but it is not required in order to play.
 Yes it does but they have an automatic timer on how long it can go unused like sitting it to the side to go to the bathroom or the kitchen for something it shuts the controller off but this is good because the battery time is amazing if you charge it right like I have but yes sixaxis is supported you bought a great controller
 There is a small hole in the back ....have u tried to reset the control??
 Hi there, The item you are referring to is a wireless Bluetooth controller. Hope that helps! Thank you, Rebecca SlickBlue
 Yes it is useful. But you have to create a psn account from usa.
 You wait for the card to arrive.
 Works on anything. They send the code I think in the mail and you redeem on the playstation store
 It works just for one account...
 they sent me an actual card
 You could have gotten the option to get it online, this one actually comes to your house.
 The expiration date is 1 year from the date you register.
 No. Just works with us accounts! You need to create one!
 I dont own as PlayStation 4 but the discount and the PlayStation Plus membership do work on one account. But any game that you would download for free via Playstation Plus, you can still play those games on a different account as long as theyre on your PS of course.
 It was a PSP game that never got localized, but far as I know there are independent stories so were free to buy this one without any problem.
//www.siliconera.com/2013/12/17/conception-ii-collectors-edition-announced-nintendo-3ds-vita/
 If you type in Conception 2 Vita on Youtube theres 7 pages of videos of it.
 Yes, it does
 The first print run is the collectors edition as is typical with Atlus games.
 I am also in Japan, playing on a NA account, and it has been difficult trying to renew my subscription over here. Mogstation wont accept my Visa, presumably because it now recognizes its not in the same country as the billing address. I can confirm that these cards do work for people in our situations - youll enter it into the MogStation website. Ive seen FF14 cards in the convenience stores over here - make sure you dont use these, because they wont work with a NA account. And for anyone else curious, there is surprisingly no extra lag or noticeable difference in gameplay when playing here. Ive only noticed somewhat longer loading times.
 yes it would. the lodestone ( ffxiv service page) will allow you to load service via a game time card to add service.
 Its a game time card for the whole service. Doesnt matter what you play the game on. You could also go to the moghouse and pay for time there. The mog house is where you access your ffxiv account.
 No just log into your square enix account and put the code on the card in at the mog station redeem code tab and thats it.
 Yes, you can have the same account with the two platforms- time would be shared.

 It does not come with one. There are special controller bundles that come with rechargeable packs. Otherwise you would need to buy a separate rechargeable battery pack for it.
 Yes, Im using this with my Windows 8 rig and the wireless adapter/receiver, works flawlessly. There is little to zero lag between controller input and what happens on screen.
 All of the systemrequirements are listed on the game box.
 No, online subscription isnt required or to my knowledge even available.
 Only one dvd and it has 5 different games on it. It has 1 and 2 plus the expansions to them. Lots of hours and fun. I am glad that I bought this. Good luck to you.
 I have this game, How would I know if Starforce is on the game.
 As far as I can tell it seems to be English only. I checked the options section and there are no buttons to change language settings. Maybe the developer might have info I could not find. Hope this helps.
 No but theyre pretty cheap on Amazon
 This 2DS comes with a grey wall charger, stylus, directions and a preloaded game. Basically everything you need to start playing right out of the box.
 I believe so.
 I didnt lose my preloaded data when I sent mine in for repairs.
 Mac OS x 10.9, 10.8, 10.7, 10.6 2 GB free disk space, DVD optical drive. Hope this helps.
)
 I bought it for use with Skyrim bought in the UAE. I could download via my US account, but not play)
 Yes. I believe you can change the language in game.
 Just the expansions, not the base game
 Yes, but how much it changes the game depends on whether you play on PC or console. All a patch does on a console is fix glitches and bugs and such with the game itself. On PC it does the same but in a way that changes the game in a few ways; for instance there is a patch that fixes the infamous dragon stalking glitch, where dragon skeletons follow you throughout the map, by erasing the dragon skeleton itself as soon as you fast travel away from it. Patches for console dont work this way. If you are on console the only way to really change the game is through DLCs and modded saves, not patches in other words. The most a patch for console will change is how merchants act and erase the ability to take advantage of various glitches. Thats about it.
 I am pretty sure that it would be good for League of Legends. You can install the CD driver, and customize your buttons and also DPI.
 i really didn\t understand why they called it power button, its just another button and as the other is full customizable at the 5 different profiles.. only one button is not customizable and is a little one located below the mouse and its a profile changer, so its perfect solution for changing from an specific game profile to another one.
//redragonzone.com/en/download.aspx then click on Mammoth Driver, hopefully it works. Or you can contact the company on the website and they might be able to send you something more specific. Hope this helps.
 The left button click is semi-loud in a quiet environment. Nothing crazy though. The right button is quieter. On a 1-10 scale, 10 being VERY LOUD, id give this mouse a 6-7 overall.
 3.25 wide, 5 long and 1.7 deep, it\s really pretty big and would be great for fps cuz the side buttons are very easy to reach and really easy to change the DPI on the fly plus its programmable.
 They are both excelent, the Redragon is just a bit too large for my hand.
 Yes, the mouse does work with Vista, its a fantastic mouse, its the best mouse Ive ever had in my opinion.
//www.curse.com/addons/wow/razernaga Did you install the perdition software for the mouse? Mine worked in Wow before I used the add on but I had been playing with the software before that to.
 The red button can be programmed. It is like all the other buttons on the mouse, just red(maybe it is a common fire button spot)
 the box says 18 months
 Yes
 Yes. It should just stick right on the glass. You just have to plug the USB plug into a USB port (I use one of the front ones on my Xbox 360) to power the LED. It will actually probably stick better on the glass CRT TV than on a flat screen because the glass should be a better surface for the suction cups.
 It has a pull off tab on each suction and can be put on and off as many times as you want from tv to any screen you like. If the suction does not cling on as easy after taking it off clean it with a wet cloth and try again it again it more then likely has dust after cleaning it will stick again ..hope this answers your question.
 Good question. Go to Youtube and search for COD Ghosts Hacks. You wont believe all the different hacks that are available and that are being used everyday. How about modded controllers ? Hundreds available thru Amazon. Nothing like shooting a bulldog shotgun with rapid fire. Seems to me that if you not cheating, then you are behind the curve. You are not playing on a level playing field anymore. Ive played in a lot of matches, that if you ADS then shoot, your dead. Using the HipShotDot will help you get more kills from hipfire. Cheating, maybe, maybe not. Using the dot has helped me a little bit. I still like using the Variable Magnification Reflex sight for longer shots, but when your face to face with another player, put the red dot on him and fire. Spray and pray if you have to, kill or be killed. Remember that some of the best players having been drawing a red dot on a piece of tape and sticking it on their screen for years.
 Its alot easier to see in the dark both for quick sighting and spraying with accuracy in a dark building or room. It gives you that extra edge if you need to even the odds alittle.
 It ends how the second movie ends --- ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* They pour the gold on the dragon and then he leaves. Ends with Smaug flying off to Lake Town, and the dwarfs have the mountain. Cliff hanger I guess yeah. But expected. ********END SPOILER ALERT*********
 There are checkpoints. We always save at a checkpoint; however, I am not sure they really save the level. The checkpoints are statues with a white circle in front of them. Have your child save there and then see if it does save the level. And be sure to quit and save when you end the game. Hope this helps.

 No, Wii U games will only work on the Wii U. The hardware inside the system is very different, so the publisher would need to create a separate Wii version. Unfortunately it looks like there will be very few new games available for the original Wii at this point.
 All
 Yes, you use the nunchucks. Unfortunately we have the same problem. It is the wires getting pulled and loose.
 Well usually hitting a button on the second controller should start the second player. At least that is what it was like on the ps3 version of Indiana Jones I had.
 It only covers the first two movies. The third is supposed to be released as downloadable content.

 Yes. 1080p Blu ray quality vs 760 for much crisper look but most importantly its the physics and lighting engines that are much better. I love both platforms but Tombraider shows u the future of games to come on PS4. U might play in 1080 on ps3 on your tv but its stepped up.
 PS4 games arent region locked, but however their downloadable contents are , since this game is complete with everything included in it, you dont need to worry about that either. You can easily play it on your indian ps4.
 I Bought it used but as far I can recall the outfits are in the disk so the tomb should be there too
 No, not on this version. However, there are many language packs, including Korean, available. There may be a localized version, or a pack available for download on PC.
 Single player with an online multiplayer component.
 If you are speaking of Stereoscopic 3D, Farsight just released patches to all current tables as well.as DLC on the PS3 to add this feature and plans on adding this coming soon to the PS4 version as well. So to answer your question.... NO, but it will.
 I would have thought they would have come with it but from what I could tell, they are nowhere. The disk I later realized was the same price as buying all the season 1 tables from PSN without any pro packs, so there really isnt any advantage to getting the disk over buying as a digital download
 Im sorry, Ive never heard of that game. If you like real pinball machine, current or retro, you will like this
 pinball arcade is a great game! lots of tables and great graphics. I feel the flipper action could be a little tighter, ever though its barely noticeable there is a slight lag
 No it is PS4 only.

 being that it is fufilled by amazon, yes it ships to APO
 There is an online store called the Xbox Live Marketplace. From there you can search for anything like games, movies, or music. After finding something you would like to purchase, you enter your credit card, or paypal, and purchase the item. After purchasing, your item will immediately start downloading onto our xbox 360. After your download has finished, you can see it in the Recent tile on the main dashboard.
 Yes it is
 Shrooms makes it loom like rainbows!
 nothing, thats why the seller hasnt answered the question nor have they sold the system.
 500GB
 lol, no, itll be just the console. You are better off waiting 2-3 months for the white one at the end of october.
 Nope just the system.
 Definitely.. I have the same problem but its easily adjustable because all music players come with the option of balancing between drivers. So just go to your music players settings and tweak to suit
 It dos not work as Bluetooth device at all. Works as wired head phone. Even touch control does not respond for muting.
 As long as the device has blue tooth capability, it should link it without a problem.
 Yes, you could hear the sound.The headphone can connect with the PS3
 The blue light is directed downwards, and it is quite dim. It doesnt bother me, and I suppose it doesnt bother people around me.
 As long as the device you are using is compatible. Make sure that 3.5 mm jack on your PS4 controller is compatible with the RaveTouch input jack. This is very important; because the jacks on some PS4 controllers are smaller than the standard size used on most headsets and devices. If it matches, I highly recommend you get this headphone. What a sound! You will not be disappointed !
 Yes, It works great with both my tablet and computer.
 Yes
 No idea... But when they worked, I loved them.... Then they didnt, after about 15 hours of use.
 I believe this is a knock off. It feels and looks like a real controller though. It has the same case as the real controller. Just the case has chinese letters. Ive had the controller for 2 weeks now and I have had no problems. So for the price, I would get it.
 yes i have played on 8.1 and i works great
 Yes, Ive used it on a number of games on 8.1 with no problems.
 No its in English. There is English and Japanese voice overs though. It can be changed on the game options.
 Yes, there is tutorials for newcomers and I suggest you read it careful too plus dont speed through it.

 The Problem for you and Others,is Amazon should have put or shown the back of the Box as well ,to answer; yes and no,let me explain; Quoted from the box; then it will answer almost any question; From the box; Tomb of the Lost Adventurer , 6 outfits for Lara ( nothing sexy ) kind of ugly(my opinion) ,8 Multiplayer Maps, 6 Multiplayer weapons ( that is what you asked specifically) 4 Multiplayer characters . so once you have certain levels in multiplayer you can attain these ,need be,play on single person or private .BUT; note the downloads are not in the disc you must REDEEM 8 long codes to, get these items ,you start with nothing and work your way up .(Spoilers Ahead) the weapon or pistol is simply that in single player and you must find parts or earn them as you level up in the game ,different areas,etc.. If you have the game and like it then ,i wouldnt even get this,the only reason i did ,i have been collecting Tomb Raider or Lara Croft items Many years,this kind of ticked me off when they could have included these items on the disc for a G.O.T.Y. ,all companies are lazy and stingy now..hope i helped some..Later....
 I just checked and unfortunately it does not have Portuguese voice, but it does have Portuguese subtitles.
 I believe it is, I dont know anything about the definitive edition I think the definitive edition is Xbone exclusive, while the GotY ediotion is for 360.
 Yes it is, I have both a PS3 and PS4 and it works perfectly with them. With the 3 you must attach the adaptor cable though but with the 4 you can plug it straight into the controller. Hope this helps!
 Hello, You can use the Inline cable as long as your TV has an audio output section on it which is attached to the inline. The PS4 itself does not have these connections so as long as you can connect to a RCA output via your TV you will be able to use the inline.
 No
 It can extend, but big ears no
 I want to say 4 to 5 inches. Its plenty long enough to reach the front of your mouth

 No, the angel wings come in the first CE. This one has no exclusive in game contents... Sad.
 If you mean by DLC the hearthstone codes yes, for the other things no, since when you register the game it registers as the CE and it gives you automatically the other things

 The colors are locked to the 4 presets as far as I can tell, but you can change the sensitivity of each preset. Usually the most sensitive preset is this weird pink color, but I changed it so that the green color was the most sensitive because I like it more.
 Likely yes. However, you will give up convenient color/speed/button setting features.
 I think that is the weights in the mouse
 PCH-1001 - OLED Screen, no 3G
 Yes it does it comes with everything a brand new one would
 Yes, I think so. I just downloaded it onto 8.1, and it is running fine.

 Dear Margie, You have to uninstall old version of the game manually, then you will be able to update the game without any problems. Thank you!
 No it is not. I found the All-in-One Solitaire really disappointing. I deleted it from my computer.
 I like the games sometimes, too, but sometimes I dont. My favorite is Triple Free Cell, but it takes sort of a long time to play, and a good bit of patience. Once in a while, when I have finally reached the point so I will win, one of the cards just takes off on its own, drifts right off the page! And the whole thing freezes. Nothing more you can do. Frustrating.

 No I never have overheating issues..heat dissipates up so a vent on the bottom wouldnt matter
 No I dont think so. But there is an inter cooler accessory similar to this one with extra USB ports just without the led lifhts
 I bought the limited edition for $35 and it didnt really come with anything cool. So just stick with the standard because I just checked the price for the limited and Its not worth it.
 Just English
 No
 This means that you can play the game everywhere across the world. Like if you live in Europe, Africa, Asia and America the disc works in all of them.
 Yes
 Yes it absolutely will. Elite Dangerous has a specific setting for the x-55 stick under control settings. Also all of the buttons on the x-55 stick can be easily re-configured any way you want them. So any button can become whatever you want that button to be. Hope that makes sense.
 Considering aircraft in real life are not built with left-handed configurations, I very much doubt it. Left-handed pilots in the modern-day Air Force simply learn to fly the standard configuration.

 Uh... Amazon does. Just add it to your cart and check. Youll have to pay the import taxes upfront. Those are MORE expensive than the unit... But itll get sent straight to your house. No fuss. I just tried with my address (Im from Rio de Janeiro), and the total was about US$ 443.00. Still... This seems to be in pre-order? 1-3 months to ship... The Saitek site has as of today (Aug 28) pre-order buttons. Maybe theyre out of stock?
 The X52s stick was way to loose for me for precision corrections. It also had a dead zone that I just didnt like. X-55 is much, much better.
 If you attach the controller to the charging cable wires... yes but if you have a ps4 charging dock it will not work with grips on.
 Definetely no need for removal
 It doesnt effect mine at all, u know when u have no skin on it an u move it up an down it makes like a crack or a snap noise u may not hear that but it doesnt make a difference with the mobility but if u do have a problem u jus may need to adjust the skin on the controller jus by pushing down under the analog when the skin is on an u should have no problems...
 Our store will ship out in 24 hours if you purchase from us.
 Not terribly heavy. Probably weighs as much as my 15 laptop. Hope this helps.

 Got my e-mail yesterday saying it will be delivered on the 8th so it looks like we have to wait. Not too happy about that.
 No the ps vita is not region locked. Japanese games should work fine
 I doubt it. The back bracket wouldnt stay in place or support the weight. I ordered a different one that cost a little more and am quite satisfied. They were quite good about arranging the return and refund. I bought a PDP Kinect TV Mount.
 No they are two different set-ups, one wont work for the other
 I\d be surprised if it did. I bought this for my flat 42 LG and it wouldn\t lock tight up top and sat flimsily on top of my television. Spend the extra few bucks for the PDP mount.
 Yes it does.
 I would say yes as long as the tv is facing at a downward angle with at least 3 inches or more space between wall and mount if that makes any sense. Hope that helps if flat it will either fit or wont. Sorry if it doesnt as my tv is not on my wall.
 I recently bought one of these controllers and they work great. I have never owned an actual SCUF so I cant compare, but the paddles do not seem hard to press at all. The only problem I had with mine was that it was difficult to plug the microphone in to the controller because the motherboard inside was slightly off. I contacted the seller and he walked me through how to deal with the issue. It works fine now. Hope this helps.
 No. It doesnt.
 I have no clue they never respond to service requests
 No, it doesnt look yellowish in my HDTV using this VGA cable. I would double check the color settings on your HDTV first to make sure your cabel is not defective.
 You get an RCA adapter that allows you to connect the red and white cable and convert them into a standard headphone output.
 The cable didnt work on my TV. On a computer monitor it looked amazing. Only way I can see it working is with a VGA to HDMI adapter, but you have to dish out some extra bucks. The cheap ones do not work. I tried two and the colors had a yellow hue. Test the cable first on a monitor, if its clear it works. If its still bad its possible you may have a defect.

 Not all Dreamcast games are VGA compatible. There are workarounds for some of those that arent, bit you would have to search for that online. Most games will work even if not advertised though. If it is not working on any games, you may want to check your setup or see about returning it. Mine works with almost any game.
 I have the xp400s and it works fine for me, if you headset has the 2.5mm plug on it and your controller/ adapter has the 3.5mm plug, then yes, it will work. I have an Xbox One and the chat headset adapter

 Umm.. Not quite sure what you mean. In my set up, this cord connects to my controller and headsets mic output. Its the part that allows others to hear me in chat. Everything I use is corded though. If you can transmit your voice in chat with out a cord connected to your controllers mic input, this cord isnt needed.
 the battery life is very good, the duration is 7 hours or more. I charge every 2 days.
 Hi, yes you CAN use this via 3.5mm jack (the cable is included). Sound quality stays the same when the battary is charged but if your battary is dead and you are using it with the cable plugged into PS4 controller the sound quality will be lower but I repeat ONLY if the battary is dead, if it is NOT, it will work like a pro either wired or wirelessly. Hope this helps. I sometimes forget I have them on, thats how unbelievably comfortable they are. I think the sound is comming from my sound system and have to actually feel my head to make sure they are on (I think that only happens when the volume is lowered) with the volume high you wount have this problem.
 You can adjust the volume and chat sound to make each loader or quieter, or turn off each all together.
 Ive tried it on both the PS3 and PS4 with Frozen, which has 7.1 sound track. And it does seem to handle the surround sound well enough that you can definitely discern ambient sounds, directionality of movement and effects, and separation of musical instruments from each other. Its not the GREATEST surround sound headset, but I can still enjoy the movie using them. FYI, I use this for my XBone as well.
 Yes you can..it works also on other devices such as music players and mobile phones by using the 3.5 mm cable...its included in the package

 Hi, yes you CAN use this via 3.5mm jack (the cable is included). Sound quality stays the same when the battary is charged but if your battary is dead and you are using it with the cable plugged into PS4 controller the sound quality will be lower but I repeat ONLY if the battary is dead, if it is NOT, it will work like a pro either wired or wirelessly. Hope this helps. I sometimes forget I have them on, thats how unbelievably comfortable they are. I think the sound is comming from my sound system and have to actually feel my head to make sure they are on (I think that only happens when the volume is lowered) with the volume high you wount have this problem.
 You can adjust the volume and chat sound to make each loader or quieter, or turn off each all together.
 Ive tried it on both the PS3 and PS4 with Frozen, which has 7.1 sound track. And it does seem to handle the surround sound well enough that you can definitely discern ambient sounds, directionality of movement and effects, and separation of musical instruments from each other. Its not the GREATEST surround sound headset, but I can still enjoy the movie using them. FYI, I use this for my XBone as well.

 Yes, full support for anything above Ubuntu 12.04
 The Leap Motion can be used as a mouse but requires complex handling and clicking is very tricky sometimes,...I wouldnt count on it...
 it can be around 10 inches away side to side but not back and fourth
 There are apps that will allow you to program actions for your personal use, such as programming a swipe as skipping a slide in powerpoint, but this can be complex, though there may be apps that assist you in this already...
 if you want motion controlling for gaming i think youve only got the razer hydra for now.
 All 3DS games work on the 2DS. So yes, this one does work.
 I think you need to set your DS settings to Spanish, the games that have the language will automatically appear in Spanish then.
 You need to be able to read
 A child who couldnt read would be frustrated by this game. 99% of the game is not voice-acted, so they wouldnt understand what was going on. Theres a note on the back of the box as well that says reading ability is required to play, which is completely true. The ability to read character dialogue and game menus is absolutely necessary.
 AR cards come with the system when you buy it. Sometimes,but rarely will games come with AR Cards. ( When I say rarely I mean RARELY)

 Yes it does require an internet connection and the Steam application installed to be able to play the game, even straight out of the box with the CD key. I hope this answer helps you, I did not know that before purchasing and I am unable to play because I do not have an internet connection where I am at this time. Once you are able to get online and activate it with Steam though, apparently you have to set STEAM to offline play (while being online) then afterwards, internet is not required - just activation.
 alright the answer to your question is yes. You need access to steam however but you dont need to be connected to the internet. simply open steam in offline mode and go from there. Usually my steam account opens as soon as i log on to my computer then gives me a choice to connect to the internet or continue and open steam in offline mode. Open it in Offline and you can play Civ 5 offline. hope this makes sense
 It comes with a cd that you can load the game off of. According to the booklet you dont have to download it via the cd and can just activate it from steam, but I dont have any experience with that so Im not sure how that would work out for you.
 Yes
 To receive all of the DLC (Brave New World and others) youll need to activate the CD key through Steam where you will be able to download the game and all of its components. Keep in mind that you will need an account with Steam and have the Steam Client installed.
 Have the same question. Even Best Buy has them on the store shelves for 69.99 each. And the combo should be significantly less since it probably only has 1 transceiver, and 1 extender cable.
 I just went to my neighbors to type this sentence, 3 walls and 30 feet away,worked fine. It started breaking up at 4 walls and 40 feet away. It is not bluetoothe. It is the standard 2.4 ghz. and works 10 times better than any bluetoothe. I have had absolutely no problems with the unifying adapter. I have accumulated 2 marathon mice, and this keyboard mouse set. The unifying recievers all work great and brain dead easy to pair up. Love the quite keyboard and smooth feeling keys. I am spoiled with this set. Im sure it will work with your dell or any computer.
 I am sure it will void the warranty.
 My keyboard is relatively close to my computer and I have no latency.
 Yes.

 Yes, in either 32 or 64 bit versions.
 Its similar to other MMO style games. The game is designed for players who like to explore and quest along the lines of Skyrim. Instead of kill 10 bandits or collect 10 plants objectives the game has you in the role hero wandering around saving individuals, towns, cities and kings. The game is different from other MMOs in that all skills are available. All professions, weapons, armor and skill trees with enough skill points available (a lot of work) to fill them all out on one character. PvP is similar to GW2s eternal battleground open WvWvW with the 3 factions fighting over lots of objectives. ESOs open world PvP is huge, much larger than GW2 even with all 4 zones added together. A lot more fun than GW2 to me, controlling certain scrolls gives PVE bonuses to the whole faction. Fully leveling a character through questing takes you to all 5 zones in all three factions. Thats a lot of questing so I can see why players who dont like to quest or enjoy story lines would get bored with the game.

 Yes. I have a gaming desktop and a laptop, both with Windows 8.1, and Civ 5 runs just fine although I definitely have to play the game at low settings across the board on my laptop. (Intel Core i5 Ivy Bridge, Intel HD Graphics 4400) Looking at the hardware on the Surface Pro 2, it looks like youll be able to run the game but expect low framerates if youre playing at 1920x1080. Ive also noticed better performance running the game in DirectX 9 mode on my laptop as opposed to DirectX 11 so you may want to go that route as well.
 Gill, It appears to install the expansion packs you dont have. The game I had in progress continued from where I had left off, although it was obvious from the opening screenshots that new content had been added overall. Hope this helps.

 It will, but not all at once. From the EU version, it seems like Campaign Pack 1 (with Shigechi and Kira) is already out, while Campaign Pack 2 will be out May 14, most likely including Fugo and Iggy. It seems like theyre going the same route as the JP version did by releasing DLC with their respective campaigns every 2-3 weeks.
 The Amazon pre-order unfortunately only gives you Shigechi. In order to have gotten Kira DLC you would have had to prs-order from namco bandais website.
 Amazon e-mailed me the code about a day or two before release date. I pre-ordered the game around March. If you ordered from Amazon, check your spam folder or old e-mail.
 Its mandatory and about/around 2GB.

 Hi, Yes work this Gaming Headset Sentey with Skype , not problem at all
 Hi , No it is only for PC, works in all the functions only with computers
 Yes the Sentey headset works with either of them
 I hoped for it to work with my xbox as well pc. But when I plug in the headset to the xbox360 my xbox fails and freezes as I think it just cant handle it as its taking to much battery or something or could be the software etc. But I have one of the first xboxs so it might just be the originals and maybe an xbox elite could handle it but mine cant.
 Hi.! Harmoniq Pro is top of the level because them comes with 6 real drivers , 3 on each ear, so the 5.1 is this headset is real with 5 real drivers + 1 subwoofer real, not virtual by software, in the Symph and Vibros the 7.1 are Virtual not real, is it made by software, the sound quality in the Harmoniq is very very high compared with Symph and Vibros. This 2 are not bad, but Harmoniq are top level.
 yes, right
 The box is very nice. its lined, and has a flop-over section that keeps it shut. Nice storage for the headphones, but I use it for other things....its that nice. User manual? Eh...just big. Other stuff is nerd-riffic! If you are not into gaming, its nothing special.
 swivels up and down to out of way and is flexible boom
 Works fine on my 2009/2010 macbook pro, so you should be good to go
 I do not think so. I only have a PC, but the box and instructions only address the PC and say system requirements == Windows 8, 7, and Vista.

 No.
 I was surprised by that too. I dont really know why that is the case. If I were to guess they may have stopped production of those models (the 250gb Last of Us and the 500gb slim). Since there are less of those models in the wild now Amazon may be pricing them higher. That was my reasoning but I dont have any definitive information.
 Yes
 Its super easy to play with a keyboard and mouse. There were even times where i would lay down while I played. You only use about 6 buttons on the keyboard, and they are all pretty close to each other. If you dont already have a gamepad, i would suggest not getting one for this game.
 You must play on-line by UPLAY.

 It\s like a regular TV remote (it\s only on when it transmits a signal). The only difference is that if you move it the buttons light up.
 It works the same as a controler just with out ABYX buttons it has a ok and back button arrows and basics play functions.
 No. Just the xbox one.
 No, not that I am aware of. And with the lack of CEC-HDMI capability, it is doubtful. The current IR blaster support for receivers is very basic.
 It will control any features that the Xbox One can control on the Tivo. So, if the TV app has been set up to control the box, and you can control play/pause, fast forward, and rewind with the Xbox, then the remote can control those features as well. The only difference I have noticed is, you will sometimes have to press the select button after the action button - so to fast forward, you will press the fast forward key (which will show the Xbox controls, with the fast forward option highlighted) then press the select button to send the fast forward command to the box.
 Yes, it will provide game and chat audio to any headphones, however you cant chat back without a mic in the headphones
 Yes it will. I use my TB XP500 using this adapter and a 2.5mm cable which I had to buy separate. I believe your A50s already have the cable so you would be set. Enjoy the way your headsets were meant to be used, finally.
 Yes its going to provide audio from any app you open in the xbox one.
 The only mic volume that you can adjust is the one from other people that are talking to you. I dont know if you can change how loud your mic is though.
 Some controllers, such as both of mine, require a quick process of updating your controller. Its quite simple. 1. Place adapter on controller and turn on controller. 2. Plug in headphones. Youll be prompted if firmware is needed along with the following steps. 3. Plug the Micro USB cord into the back of your xbox and to your controller. 4. Wait 5. When finished itll ask if you would like to do another controller, go ahead do them all and be done with it. Whole process took me about 2-4 minutes and thats never have had done it before and doing 2 controllers. Quite easy and on screen prompts tell you everything you need. Big kudos to MS for making what could be a real pain in the butt into something easy and nearly idiotproof.
 No, the audio plays on the headset and television simultaneously. I find myself turning the television volume all the way down so you cant hear it anymore and just using the headset. It sure helps when dont want to wake anyone up at night.
 You can actually use as many as you have controls. The headset plugs directly into the control so it uses the same signal.
 It just plugs into your controller. No extra batteries needed
 It does not come with a mic monitor and you cannot hear yourself thru the mic when you speak. Sorry.

 I dont think you can. Your wii probably needs to be shut down or reset. When you open the cover there should be a red button just push it and it should reset the console. It shouldnt delete anything. If not then the disc needs to be cleaned.
 No you dont you can play with the game pad an wii/nun chuck.
 can the xbox one work in the uk ?considering their current
 Hi danny, unfortunately....xbox one only accepts xbox one games. We cannot play xbox 360 games on it.
 It does! I was actually surprised that it did.
 If you believe the NSA can spy on you through your kinect than you would be foolish not to believe the NSA cannot spy on you through your cell phone or laptop camera. In other words, if you own a smart phone I think a kinect is the least of your worries... Nice try though.
 Yes
 It does, I have a Mac myself and my only problem was the shift key doesnt work with Mac so you have to use the control key as a shift button. Other than that its a great key board for Mac.
 Dear Angelpunk18, yes it has the shortcut Fn+F6 and you can Press Fn+Esc to adjust the brightness. Thank you.
 This keyboard doesnt have an nkro mode to my knowledge....in the vast majority of cases, NKRO is PS/2 only, while this is a USB board
 It has good key response! No problems with this keyboard at all!
 The dimensions of this product is 460*184*52mm( L*W*H). Thanks.
 Dear Angelpunk18, we can recommend our keyboards, but you choose any of it which you are prefer to.Thank you.
 Dear Jeffrey W, yes ,it is compatible with Macs. Thank you.
 No it doesnt which is the only thing wrong with this keyboard. The keys are comfortable and we love it even without the stands

 yes the UK PS3 version is fully compatible with the USA PS3 console, but you may need an HD hook-up (HDMI) connection to your screen. (just to note that the UK 360 version is region locked and cant be used on a US 360 console)
 I thing mxgp 14 is the US version. Mxgp originally released in Europe.
 yes sure %
 Yes
 It should be okay to play in your country. I live in the U.S. and I bought the game from the U.K. Worked fine. I dont think Playstation has zone restrictions like XBOX does.
 Yes. It has two player co op or versus offline
 You could play 2 vs 2 but the game is only 2 players. It work by you and a friend fight together with computers or fight each other with a computer partner. And if you want a 1 vs 1 press the triangle button on the square where you pick a character. If not then a computer will still be there. I hope I explained this well to you.
 Yes, the Playstation 3 is region free. (It can play games from any region)
 Yes!!! and it works perfect
 Its all Japanese

 No. The reason its not included is because the Vita version has a different enemy count per location you visit (a smaller number of baddies so the system can handle it).
 Its a Download from the PSN store with a voucher code included. It took up roughly 1.5-2 gb that I had to clear some room for.
 Load times are not bad. Frame rate drops some. I dont play multiplayer so I dont know if it reduces the number. Its better on console, but all in all a very enjoyable vita game.
 Only have the download code with the DLCs. The code was from a Borderlands PS Vita bundle. Sorry I dont have what youre looking for.
 No, the only cross platform functionality for this game is being able to transfer a save from PS3 to Vita and Vita to PS3
 Its a mistake. This does not require any batteries
 You can reassign every button on this mouse (even the DPI buttons) except for the toggle button that controls the wheel functionality. The mouses wheel can toggle between hyper scroll mode (where you can spin the wheel and it keeps spinning freely) and regular notched scroll mode. The button that toggles this mouse wheel functionality is specifically used for that purpose only.
 One notch switches one weapon. In locked mode, it\s quite sturdy indeed and there\s next to no chance of you actually scrolling the thing. In free scroll mode though, it\s extremely loose and sometimes even picking up the mouse is enough to make the scroll move.
 Yes. I thought nothing was going to be able to replace my G500 when it stopped working. The ergonomics were literally perfect for my hand, the free scrolling wheel, braided cable and the customizable weights. My G502 literally does all of that, just better. Word of caution though, as I was used to the G500 which is noticeably bigger than the 502 (and I have relatively small hands), you wont necessarily fall in love with it immediately. After about a week or so of use and the ergonomics will start to make sense. Once that happens, it becomes better than the 500.
 g502 is better in every way unless you prefer the deathadder shape or slightly lighter weight. g502 has better sensor (native at every step), build quality, software (if wanted) more buttons, features, and better customer support.
 Depending on the WiFi network you are trying to attach to, you may or may not need a network key to attach. The console itself doesnt create a WiFi to hook up to. No extra devices are needed to use the WiFi feature other than having wireless internet at home or wherever the intended location may be. You can also use a wired connection with an Ethernet cable, sold separately Im sure. Hope that answers your question.
 The downloads come from the internet, but the discs are personally purchased. No Internet is needed for the discs.
 No, you cant.
 Yes

 I downloaded it to my new pro, and a friend has it on his air. Runs flawlessly on both.
 You need Steam to download the program and get any updates. They also seem to force you to check in with them every once in a while, since the program occasionally will not work until you do. However, you can play the game off line. What I do is turn WiFi off before I boot Civilization V. This allows you to play the game without being connected to Steam.
 Yes! I play with yosemite all the time
 You have to download Steam (free) and input your code through there.
 Sure does, running it right now. If youre loading up a big game itll be a little slow to start but Ive found that to be the case regardless of platform or OS. Hope this helps
 You cannot. Moreover, you cannot run it offline.
 I\ve played the game offline dozens of times, though it does prefer you to be online for cloud based save file storage (in offline mode it saves a local copy). When I bought the game i was emailed a Product Code to activate it. Searching online I found answers that Amazon emails you the Online Game Code to activate the game. It basically means you\re getting the game\s activation code by email rather than printed and mailed to you.

 Its a subscription required game. Its about $15 (USD) per month with a declining scale if you subscribe at 3, 6, etc months. You get the first 30 days free though.
 Probably not. But you get some nice mounts. A rocket house. couple of housing items. some dyes and costume. Titles. To me.. I bought the deluxe version to save me the time of grinding money to get a mount. The ones you get you cannot use till level 25. they are giving a way a mount right now if you sign up for 2-step login verification. you cam use right away

 I would assume so. they email you the code. Then your friend should be able to make their own account w/ their email.
 It sure does! Theyll email the passes to you after a couple days and then youre free to send them to your friends.
 Yes, in fact its the only way to play on US servers. If you buy a code from one of their European gates, or even through a European amazon gate, it will only be good for Euro servers. I bought a code on US amazon for a friend in Europe and we play together on US servers.
 Youll be able to play it. Probably not not on full specs. Your RAM and GPU are fine, but a 2.0GHz processor is a bit slow. If you have the i7 it probably has TurboBoost. You should check out what the max speed is with the boost, if its above 2.4 you can definitely play it. If not you will probably have too low of a framerate for this game, it requires a lot of aiming and avoiding, which gets tough at low FPS.

 There are a huge lineups for International and Domestic teams. In Domestic arena, a current generation of lineups from Australian T20, Indian Premier League and English Cricket County. When you start playing career mode, you will be offered a contracts playing for Big Bash Australian T20 League, Indian Premier League (IPL) and English County Championship. There are also vintage lineups besides the current teams from 1980s West Indies and Pakistan, 1990s Australias teams. All of the above you can customize and create your own lineups too.
 Its region free.... I bought from UK and I am using it in USA.
 It supports up to 2 players either in the same room or via network play. It is a UK game though, so in order to support network play between 2 players a buyer would have to create a second PSN Network account under the U.K. network rather than the U.S. network if he doesnt already have a U.K. network account. its free to do so.
 Yes
 Yes
 No
 No I you cant
 yes it will work in American PS3 without any problem.
 It has all the international teams. And you can download fan made rosters through the game so u have updated rosters for each team.
 It is about $5 and
 Ive had mine for a few months. Only issue I came across was my own issue. I didnt tighten a screw all the way and I thought my sticks where warped. After I tightened it, the sticks worked good.

 We are selling actual XBone sticks with the rougher edges to the nubs but not sure others. Thanks,
 It is fairly easy to do. And it will take you 10-15 minutes to do. I would recommend to look for YouTube videos about how to dismantle a DualShock 4, as there are little parts that require attention and be careful to handle. I hope this helps.
 The box of the actual game is 11 x 8 inches. It came in a box 17 x 16 inches. Depth of about 2 inches for both.
 When you activate the game it will allow you to add ps4 to your existing account.
 Yes, it will be in you mail in the gm
 No, if PSN is down sometimes you can still log in, updates come less often but its fast
 No they are bound to you
 As for audio, you can purchase the Japanese voice tracks for the whole main game (not the DLC missions), but the subs are English only as far as I know.
 This game is NOT Demonic and it certainly isn\t Satanic. As for sexuality, besides the outfit you see the main character in on the cover, and the , very, occasional innuendo from the old perv character, there is little sexual in nature about this game. This game is more swords and sorcery. No demons and NO satanic material.
 Contrast. For every joke there\s a tear, and for every smile there\s a funeral. The characters aren\t as immediately memorable, but the Zero and her dragon Mikhail have an amazing chemistry that just overshadows everything else anyway. The overall story is a great take on the concepts of series canon and timeline effects. You\ll first need to know that each ending has a completely separate sequence of events, unlike in Nier where each new ending path led to more context on the situation. Ultimately Draken3 feels like a medieval fantasy timeline story, like a sort of Steins;Gate but Drakengard style. The other answerer to your question is rather on point, too. Ultimately it will feel very unique but worth it. Some moments will fall flat while others will be as amazing as you\d hope and each ending is unarguably charged with an explosion of emotions and revelations. Don\t go into it expecting Nier, but you can expect quality.
 it is a disk
 You dont have to buy the discs, you can download it online. You do have to pay an initial cost, but when you do, it comes with 30 days play time included. Afyerwards you just pay the sub.
 Beats me, I thought I would get an email with the code or a number, but I had to wait for the physical card. Same thing for WOW.
 Wireless. Playstation doesnt make wired controllers for the ps3 or ps4. They are blutooth so they have far better range than other console controllers.
 It comes in a cardboard sleeve.
 It has one controller with charge cable.
 You could plug your PS3 to your PC using an optical audio cable, and then you could use the PC speakers with your PS3
 Absolutely!
 I havent had a single issue with tracking on any surface I have used it on. As long as the surface is flat it tracks better than any of my razer mice. I would say it tracks far better than my old deathadder. Hope this helps!
 Thanks for your inquiry to our product. Yes, they have no difference. The aLLreli mouse is from our factory. And we supply the item and driver for them. Thanks for bringing this matter to our attention. EC Technology Customer Support cs@iectechnology.com
 Yes the old model with the OLED screen
 There a difference between recertified and refurbished. Refurbed is sold as is usually, whereas recertified still carries a warranty. Both are used and/or fixed models, which is to the reason for the lower price.
 No, it does not come with the cards
 I got the 16G its perfect for me, I downloaded a few games(4) and still have plenty of space.
 Nope, game wont start without a memory card, I tried.

 It will not work with windows xp because this game requires directx11 which xp does not support.

 When u buy the download, you have to replace the .exe with a non steam version. A quick Google search and you should find a forum or something that should point you in the right direction
 I use a site like can I play this to check whether a game will run on my computer. I play on a toshiba satellite with integrated graphics card, with no problem
 You can buy the CD-ROM from Amazon.

 Nicknames are used whenever a Mii is referred to. Only when a Mii is hosting a news program or is one of the interview subjects is their full name used or spoken, so use nicknames you dont mind hearing a lot!
 No, I dont believe there is a way to have separate save files for each player. When you save it doesnt let you pick a file.
 sure is
 You can make the kids share a game, but I dont think theyll be very happy with you. Each copy of the game only has one save file on it, meaning only one person can make a seperate game. Id say you either chip in and buy the three copies of the game, get them used for a lower price, or have the kids fight over which miis get to have certain outfits. Your choice.

 For other players to join your game, they simply need to press start with their own controllers. Also note that split-screen only works on HD TVs where the PS3 is connected to the TV with an HDMI.
 If you like building... Its kinda like Lego in a virtual world. You can build buidings & other things. Fun for kids & adults

 Thats the beauty of this game. This game is intended for new and old One Piece fans! You wont feel lost at all. Youll learn along the way, which character is which. =D
 The dlc will be able to be purchased from within the game, that connects to the e shop. ^_^ (Like an online store from inside the game).

 I would love to give you answer but Ive only played the 3DS version.... But Im sure the only difference would be even better graphics on the wii U and controls would be slightly different... You can maybe look up videos on YouTube to get a better answer though... Sorry I couldnt answer your question
 the standard edition wont give you the free costume dlc, and extra side-quest.
 I bought on Amazon and then downloaded it thru my steam account. There are directions on amazon on how to download it thru steam
 I used a wired 360 controller but not all the buttons were mapped I think it was the hitch button but that may be fixed now
 To be honest idk srry
 Yes wat kind of laptop windows or Mac
 Yes you can. I personally download from spintires.nl, but Im sure theres other websites. Although I should note is that if put mods into the game, youll not be able to play multiplayer until you take the mods out of the game. BACK UP YOUR FILES!!! I cant stress that enough. Its a little different adding mods than from the demo version.

 Yeah. They are supposed to release it separately. That way you can add it later. Maybe theyll bundle it with a game like the first one.
 Kinect is for Motion Gaming, using Gestures to control the Xbox, and most importantly voice commands. Sadly no, a different external microphone will not work for voice commands. Head over to feedback.xbox.com and suggest it, maybe they will add it.
 Yes
 yes, games can all be played offline. The system is fully operational offline.
 Most games do not require kinect. Some games have certain kinect-enabled features and others will rely on kinect extensively. It will be marked on the game packaging if kinect is required.

 Yes, that is what I have.
