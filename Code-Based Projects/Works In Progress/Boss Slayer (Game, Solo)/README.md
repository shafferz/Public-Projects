# Boss Slayer
Boss slayer is intended to be a multi-step, large-scale video game project. Without spoiling the underlying story, I can only tell you that the game will be built in a series of stages. The game will also span multiple video game genres. The game is intentionally simplistic at this stage of development. The entire entity of the game will evolve as the player progresses, and I am not referencing the story of the game. The game's UI will evolve as well, and HUD elements will be generated as needed.

This project may grow from a solo developed game into a team-based game, pending response from select colleagues who have expressed interest in my pitch for the game.
