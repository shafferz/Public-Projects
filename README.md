# Public-Projects
Projects that I have created for the public eye. 

## Code-Based Projects
In the file directory 'Public-Projects/Code-Based Projects/', you will find projects that I have completed either alone or with a team. Works in progress are in their own directory, and do not necessarily represent the look or feel of my finished softwares. The project folders have been labelled in parenthetical notation to describe the general nature of the projects contained within. The meaning of the labels are as follows:

#### Legend
- (Group/Solo)
  - Directories with the "Group" tag indicate that at least one other person worked on the code, other than myself.
  - Directories with the "Solo" tag indicate that I have worked exclusively alone on the code or project.
- (Game)
  - Directories with the "Game" tag indicate that the project or code is intended to be consumed as a video game.
- (Experiment)
  - Directories with the "Experiment" tag indicate that I have performed experiments or collected data from the project, or that the project itself was a scientific experiment.
- (Simulation)
  - Directories with the "Simulation" tag indicate that the project is designed to simulate a real-world scenario. 
- (Demo)
  - Directories with the "Demo" tag indicate that the code is a demonstration or proof-of-concept work, and is not necessarily an independent entity or comprehensive project.
  
## Research
In the file directory 'Public-Projects/Research/', you will find academic writings that came as the result of research I have done at Allegheny College. Research published in this repository strictly pertains to the realm of Computer Science, and will not contain research done outside of this field. Works in Progress are in their own directory, and do not necessarily represent the extent or breadth of my current research. 

## Accreditation and Thanks
I would like to extend my fullest gratitude to the professors who have guided my work at Allegheny, and my peers with whom I have collaborated. This includes, but is not limited to, the following individuals:
- Dr. Janyl Jumadinova, my academic advisor and professor. Oversaw work on multiple projects in this repository, guided me through course selections, and provided useful and lifelong professional advice.
- Dr. Oliver Bonham-Carter, professor. Oversaw the proposal stages of my senior thesis, as well as other research and projects in this repository.
- Tara Douglass, student and friend. Collaborated with me to create The Riddle Dungeon, and pushed me to be the best, most productive student I can be. Words cannot express my gratitude in this regard. 
- Adam Spence, student. Collaborated with me and contributed to the Allegheny College Room Draw Number Generator. Simultaneously collaborated with me to ensure the completion an unlisted project whose work schedule ran concurrent to this one, which was a tiring and arduous process for both of us. 
- Eva Fann and Lucas Hoesch, students. Collaborated with me and contributed invaluably to the Unity A* Demo, as well as spent many long, frustrating hours in the laboratory debugging and refactoring code for a language we were largely unfamiliar with.
